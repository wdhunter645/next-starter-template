- Detailed steps for using GitHub UI (recommended)
- Alternative method using GitHub CLI
- Explanation of what happens during redeploy
- Verification steps for successful deployment
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Notes on best practices

**Key Instructions:**
To retry PR#135 build:
1. Navigate to Actions → Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Set `redeploy_count: 1`
4. Click "Run workflow"

## PR#144 Review Summary

### Changes Approved ✅

#### 1. Secret Fallback
```yaml
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN || secrets.CF_API_TOKEN }}
```

**Benefits:**
- Backward compatibility with existing `CF_API_TOKEN` secret
- No need to rename secrets
- Prevents deployment failures from secret naming

#### 2. Manual Redeploy Feature
```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    redeploy_count:
      description: 'Number of previous commits to redeploy (0 to skip)'
      required: false
      default: '0'
```

**Benefits:**
- Retry failed deployments without new commits
- Redeploy last N commits with original metadata
- Useful for transient failure recovery
- Maintains deployment history

### Security Review ✅
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Proper use of GitHub secrets mechanism
- Fallback doesn't expose secret values
- Appropriate permissions (contents: read)
- No new vulnerabilities introduced

### Functionality Review ✅
- Valid YAML syntax
- Proper conditional execution
- Error handling included (`set -euo pipefail`)
- Git history handling (`fetch --prune --unshallow`)
- Build output efficiently reused
- Non-breaking changes

## How to Use the New Redeploy Feature

### For PR#135 Specifically:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Deploy to Cloudflare Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Set `redeploy_count: 1`
5. Click "Run workflow" to execute

### For Other Scenarios:
- Single commit retry: `redeploy_count: 1`
- Multiple commits: `redeploy_count: N` (where N ≤ 10 recommended)
- Normal deployment: `redeploy_count: 0` (default)

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

### Immediate Actions Available:
1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read `WORKFLOW_REVIEW_PR144.md` for detailed analysis
   - Read `RETRY_PR135_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions

2. **Retry PR#135 Build** (if needed)
   - Follow the guide in `RETRY_PR135_GUIDE.md`
   - Use GitHub Actions UI to trigger redeploy
   - Set `redeploy_count: 1` to redeploy just the PR#135 commit

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful workflow run
   - Verify Cloudflare Pages deployment
   - Confirm changes are live on production site

### Future Use:
- The manual redeploy feature is now available for any commit
- Can be used to recover from transient deployment failures
- Useful for updating deployments without code changes
- Maintains audit trail with original commit hashes
