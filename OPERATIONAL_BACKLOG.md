# Operational Backlog from After-Action Reports

**Created:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** Active  
**Purpose:** Operationalize lessons learned and follow-ups from after-action reports

---

## Executive Summary

After reviewing all after-action reports (START_HERE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md, ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md, SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md, ISSUE_31_COMPLETE.md, ISSUE_34_COMPLETE.md), we have identified 10 actionable backlog items organized by priority and dependency.

### Key Findings

- **18 MVP issues completed successfully** - Full feature set delivered
- **Security incident resolved** - .env file removed, credentials rotation documented
- **Authentication issues fixed** - Terminal-only PAT workflow established
- **Documentation proliferation** - Multiple overlapping guides need consolidation
- **No test infrastructure** - Repository lacks automated testing
- **Manual verification steps** - Production checks need automation

## Numbered Backlog Items

### High Priority (Production Critical)

**1. Consolidate Documentation Architecture**
   - **Why:** 15+ markdown files with overlapping content create confusion
   - **Impact:** Developer onboarding friction, maintenance burden
   - **Files affected:** START_HERE.md, TERMINAL_ONLY_AUTH.md, CODESPACES_TOKEN_SETUP.md, QUICK_FIX.md, GIT_AUTH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md, and others
   - **Deliverable:** Single source of truth with clear navigation

**2. Archive After-Action Reports**
   - **Why:** 7 *_COMPLETE.md files clutter root directory
   - **Impact:** Repository maintainability, unclear what's current
   - **Files affected:** IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md, ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md, SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md, ISSUE_31_COMPLETE.md, ISSUE_34_COMPLETE.md, DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md
   - **Deliverable:** Move to /docs/archive/ or consolidate into CHANGELOG.md

**3. Verify Security Incident Remediation**
   - **Why:** .env file with 18 secrets was exposed (commit 525b5ad)
   - **Impact:** Potential security breach if credentials not rotated
   - **Action:** Audit that all services have new credentials
   - **Deliverable:** Security audit checklist with verification dates

### Medium Priority (Developer Experience)

**4. Create Automated Test Infrastructure**
   - **Why:** No tests exist - manual verification only
   - **Impact:** Risk of regressions, slow CI feedback
   - **Deliverable:** Basic test setup with linting, type checking, and smoke tests

**5. Automate Production Deployment Verification**
   - **Why:** Manual checklist in ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md (line 302-310)
   - **Impact:** Deployment verification inconsistent
   - **Deliverable:** Automated script to verify all routes post-deploy

**6. Configure External Services**
   - **Why:** Elfsight and Cloudflare Analytics documented but not configured
   - **Impact:** Social wall and analytics features incomplete
   - **Deliverable:** Widget ID set, analytics enabled, documented in .env.example

**7. Standardize Helper Script Management**
   - **Why:** Multiple helper scripts (fix-git-auth.sh, create-github-secrets.sh, delete-reviewed-branches.sh, gh-login-guard.sh) lack consistent structure
   - **Impact:** Maintenance burden, unclear purpose
   - **Deliverable:** Consolidated scripts/ directory with README

### Low Priority (Optimization)

**8. Document GitHub Actions First-Run Approval**
   - **Why:** First-time contributors need manual workflow approval
   - **Impact:** Contributor friction, mentioned in copilot-instructions.md
   - **Deliverable:** CONTRIBUTING.md section on workflow approval process

**9. Create Credential Rotation Runbook**
   - **Why:** Security incident showed need for repeatable process
   - **Impact:** Faster response to future incidents
   - **Deliverable:** docs/CREDENTIAL_ROTATION.md with step-by-step guide

**10. Enhance CI/CD Pipeline**
   - **Why:** No documentation linting, broken link checking, or consistency validation
   - **Impact:** Documentation drift over time
   - **Deliverable:** GitHub Actions workflow for doc validation

## Dependency Graph

```
1. Consolidate Documentation → 8. Document GitHub Actions
2. Archive Reports → (independent)
3. Security Audit → 9. Rotation Runbook
4. Test Infrastructure → 5. Deployment Verification
6. External Services → (independent)
7. Helper Scripts → (independent)
10. CI/CD Enhancement → 4. Test Infrastructure
```

## Recommended Execution Order

**Phase 1: Foundation (Items 1-3)**
- Establish clean documentation baseline
- Archive historical reports
- Verify security posture

**Phase 2: Infrastructure (Items 4, 5, 10)**
- Build test framework
- Automate verification
- Enhance CI/CD

**Phase 3: Polish (Items 6-9)**
- Configure external services
- Standardize scripts
- Document processes
- Create runbooks

## Success Metrics

- Documentation: Single authoritative guide with < 5 cross-references
- Reports: Root directory has < 5 markdown files
- Security: 100% of exposed credentials verified rotated
- Testing: > 80% code coverage for critical paths
- Deployment: Automated verification in < 2 minutes
- Services: Elfsight widget live, Cloudflare Analytics tracking
- Scripts: All helpers in scripts/ with --help flag
- CI/CD: Documentation PRs auto-validated

---

## Working Agreement

1. All sub-issues reference this parent tracking issue
2. Each sub-issue includes A→G acceptance criteria
3. PRs close one sub-issue each (smallest viable changes)
4. No destructive changes without explicit approval
5. All changes pass lint, build, and existing tests
6. Documentation updates accompany code changes
