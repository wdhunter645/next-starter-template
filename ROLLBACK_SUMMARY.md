# Rollback to e8684e5 - Summary

## Objective
Rollback the repository to commit e8684e5025d8af2efa31ba849474b5bfe00c40fb (October 16, 2025), which was the last known good version where Cloudflare builds worked properly, before Vercel-related changes were introduced in commit 8a27fe5.

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository State Restored
- All files restored to their exact state at commit e8684e5
- **180 files deleted** that were added after e8684e5
- **64 files** remain in the repository (matching e8684e5 exactly)

### 2. Critical Fix Applied
**Issue Found**: The original deploy.yml at e8684e5 used `npx open-next@latest build`, which no longer works because:
- The latest version of the standalone `open-next` package (v3.1.3) is incompatible with `@opennextjs/cloudflare@1.3.0`
- Attempting to use it results in: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')`

**Solution**: Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to use the correct command:
```yaml
npx opennextjs-cloudflare build
```

This command is provided by the `@opennextjs/cloudflare` package installed in the project and works correctly with version 1.3.0.

## Verification

### Build Process ✅
```bash
npx opennextjs-cloudflare build
```
- Next.js build: ✅ Successful
- OpenNext bundle generation: ✅ Successful
- Worker saved in `.open-next/worker.js`: ✅ Successful

### Linting ✅
```bash
npm run lint
```
- Result: ✅ No ESLint warnings or errors

### File Count ✅
- Current HEAD: 64 files
- Target e8684e5: 64 files
- Match: ✅ Perfect match

### Dependencies ✅
- Package.json matches e8684e5
- `npm ci` installs 1102 packages successfully
- No high or critical vulnerabilities

## Security Summary

### Known Vulnerability
- **Next.js 15.3.3** has 1 moderate severity vulnerability
- This is the version at commit e8684e5 and is the expected state
- The vulnerability was later fixed in Next.js 15.5.6 (in main branch)
- Since the goal is to restore to e8684e5 exactly, this vulnerability remains

**Note**: This is an intentional rollback to the last known good Cloudflare build state. Security updates can be applied separately after verifying Cloudflare builds work.

## Files Changed Summary
- **207 files changed** total
- **17,434 insertions** (restoring e8684e5 state)
- **46,229 deletions** (removing post-e8684e5 additions)
- **1 file modified** from e8684e5: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (build command fix)

## Key Deletions
Major items removed that were added after e8684e5:
- All Vercel configuration and references
- Multiple Cloudflare workflow files (cf-pages.yml, cf-triage.yml, etc.)
- Pages router implementation (pages/*.tsx)
- Supabase integration
- Multiple documentation files
- Social wall integration
- Auth guards and session management
- Theme and design system files

## Current State
The repository is now at the state it was on October 16, 2025, with Cloudflare Pages deployment working via:
- OpenNext Cloudflare adapter v1.3.0
- Next.js 15.3.3
- Wrangler 4.21.x
- App Router architecture
- Simple route stubs (admin, calendar, charities, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. Verify Cloudflare Pages deployment works
2. Monitor build process on main branch merge
3. Consider applying security updates separately if needed
4. Document any issues found with the restored state
