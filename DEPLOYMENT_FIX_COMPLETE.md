# Deployment Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved
The automated GitHub Actions deployment workflow was failing with errors like:
```
✘ [ERROR] Unknown argument: Milestones link from homepage
```

## Root Cause
Multi-line commit messages (containing markdown, special characters, newlines from PR descriptions, and co-author tags) were being passed directly to the `wrangler pages deploy` command, causing shell parsing errors.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to extract only the first line (title) of commit messages:

```yaml
# Before (broken):
--commit-message="${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}"

# After (fixed):
COMMIT_MSG=$(echo "${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}" | head -n 1)
--commit-message="$COMMIT_MSG"
```

## Changes Made

### 1. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Added shell variable to extract first line of commit message
- Added explanatory comment
- Ensures single-line messages that won't break shell parsing

### 2. `README.md`
- Removed outdated deployment warning
- Added documentation for required GitHub secrets
- Clarified automated deployment process

### 3. `DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Documented the actual issue and resolution
- Kept API token permission guidance for reference
- Explained why the fix works

## Validation
✅ YAML syntax validated
✅ Code review completed (no issues)
✅ Security scan completed (no vulnerabilities)
✅ Build process verified locally

## Expected Behavior
- Every push to `main` will trigger the deployment workflow
- The workflow will build using OpenNext
- The build will deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- Deployment will succeed with single-line commit titles

## Required Secrets
The workflow requires these GitHub repository secrets:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` or `CF_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME`

## Next Steps
Once this PR is merged to `main`:
1. The workflow will run automatically
2. Monitor the deployment at: https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/actions
3. Verify the site is deployed to Cloudflare Pages
4. The automated deployment pipeline will be fully functional
