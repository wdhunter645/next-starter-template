name: Legacy LGFC-main Workflow (Parked)

# This workflow belonged to the pre-LGFC-Lite architecture (Next.js/Vercel).
# It is intentionally disabled during the LGFC-Lite phase to avoid false failures.
# When LGFC main resumes, replace this stub with a new implementation
# aligned to the current architecture and the governance docs in /docs.
