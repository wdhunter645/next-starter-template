## Classification evidence

Record the matrix row or contract outcome used to finalize fields above:

- Work-size contract row or rationale:
- Model A/B decision evidence (if Medium):
- Protected-change paths touched (if any):
- Emergency exit used: NO / YES — rationale if YES

## Scope

### Allowed paths

- `path/to/file`
- `path/to/directory/**`

All other paths are out of scope.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Stable metadata recorded on the issue and matching PR
- [ ] Changed files stay inside the allowlist
- [ ] Verification evidence attached to the PR

## Rollback

<!-- One-step, multi-step, or emergency-stabilization action for this task. -->

## Stop rule

Stop only for authority conflict, missing allowlist, or a material business/security decision. Routine template, label, ruleset, and evidence corrections remain in scope.

## Optional: Issue-side PR contract

A task may optionally publish a marked, versioned Issue-side PR contract for automated preclearance, per `docs/reference/ci/issue-pr-contract.md`. This is a design-time specification only — no label, workflow, or automatic PR creation is enabled by adding this section to a task.
