# Cross-Agent Operating Rules

## Purpose

This document makes LGFC repository work repeatable across ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, Cubic, Deepwiki, Semgrep, and future agents.

## Shared rules

All agents must follow [`docs/ops/ai/SHARED-AGENT-RULES.md`](../../docs/ops/ai/SHARED-AGENT-RULES.md) and the detailed rules in [`docs/ops/ai/CORE-RULES.md`](../../docs/ops/ai/CORE-RULES.md).

In addition:

1. Read `Agent.md` first.
2. Use the relevant `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` file when the task matches a skill trigger.
3. Follow the source Issue exactly.
4. Preserve canonical design and governance references.
5. Keep diffs narrow and reviewable.
6. Run applicable checks.
7. Report limitations without guessing.

Do not duplicate shared law in agent-specific files; cross-link instead.

## Role mapping

- Design agents define scope and acceptance criteria.
- Execution agents edit files only within the approved scope.
- Verification agents check the diff, tests, docs, and policy compliance.
- Governance agents enforce Issue-first workflow, file allowlists, labels, and documentation authority.
- Troubleshooting agents isolate failure, prefer rollback-first correction, and document evidence.
- Worklist agents track status without changing product behavior.

## Handoff contract

A valid handoff includes:

- What changed.
- Why it changed.
- Source Issue.
- Files touched.
- Verification performed.
- Remaining risks.

## Drift control

If an agent finds useful but out-of-scope work, it must not include that work in the current PR. It must create or recommend a separate Issue instead.

## Enforcement

The repository enforces this structure through:

- Root `Agent.md`.
- Repo-scoped skill files.
- Agent governance checks.
- PR issue-accounting checks.
- Intent labels and file allowlists.
