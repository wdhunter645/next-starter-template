# DIATAXIS MAPPING

## Purpose

Defines complete mapping from legacy documentation to Diataxis structure.

This document is the single source of truth for:

- transition coverage
- migration status
- routing vs full-document decisions

Program 1 Task 004 (`#1342`) populated legacy root rows below. Full per-file
migration execution remains deferred to Program 3 unless promoted.

Status report: `docs/reports/program-1-diataxis-transition-status.md`

---

## Coverage Model

- Total legacy root groups mapped: **6** (agent rules, cross-agent ops, governance ai, prompts, split trackers, archive candidates)
- Total DIATAXIS targets referenced: **15+** canonical paths across `docs/ops/ai/`, `docs/governance/standards/`, `docs/how-to/cursor/`, `docs/reference/website/`, and `docs/ops/trackers/`
- Coverage status: **Phase 1 status complete** — row-level retirement execution deferred Program 3

DIATAXIS is considered 100% complete for Phase 1 when:

- every required legacy root has a DIATAXIS entry (full, routed, or retain)
- split authority paths name one recommended canonical target per topic

## Split Agent Authority — Canonical Target Summary

One recommended canonical target per topic (details in status report):

| Topic | Canonical target |
|---|---|
| Shared agent law | `docs/ops/ai/SHARED-AGENT-RULES.md` |
| Cross-agent handoff | `docs/ops/ai/CROSS-AGENT-OPERATING-RULES.md` *(after Program 3 move)* |
| Long-form agent governance | `docs/governance/standards/agent-governance.md` *(after Program 3 authoring)* |
| Cursor program execution | `docs/reference/pmo/lgfc-cursor-execution-contract.md` |

---

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Migrated** | Authoritative content lives at the DIATAXIS target; legacy duplicate absent or non-authoritative |
| **Retain** | Document stays at listed path; may carry routing banner; not scheduled for immediate move |
| **Deferred Program 3** | Mapping decided; file move, rewrite, or retirement executes under `#1132` / Program 3 only |

Legacy vocabulary (still used in `#1132` matrix):

- Viable → clean migration possible
- Weak → rewrite required
- Duplicate → remove or consolidate
- Missing → new DIATAXIS document required

---

## Action Definitions

- **Migrate** → convert legacy to DIATAXIS with minimal change
- **Rewrite** → create new DIATAXIS document
- **Route** → DIATAXIS routing document or banner references legacy; legacy not ops authority
- **Retire** → remove legacy after validation and manifest row

---

## Rules

- Every legacy root group in the Phase 1 audit appears exactly once in the table above
- Every mapping resolves to one DIATAXIS target (existing or planned)
- No unmapped legacy roots from the audit remain
- DIATAXIS remains authoritative at all times per `/docs/ops/pmo/diataxis-legacy-retirement-policy.md`
- This table records status only; it does not execute retirements

---

## Transition Tracking

- DIATAXIS coverage is Phase-1-complete for audited legacy roots (full, routed, or retain)
- Legacy usage should decrease as Program 3 migration PRs land
- `LEGACY_FALLBACK` events should create or update mapping gaps before reuse

---

## Notes

Population completed in Program 1 Task 004 (`#1342`). Prior scaffold rows replaced.
Full per-file inventory expansion remains Program 3 scope.
