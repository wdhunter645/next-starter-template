# Lou Gehrig Source Provenance Model

## Purpose

This reference defines required source metadata, credit display needs,
contributor/researcher evidence handling, and conflicting-source rules for
Lou Gehrig content collection.

## Provenance principles

- Every collected item retains original source location, retrieval context, date
  seen, contributor/researcher, and review state.
- Public display must include appropriate source/credit language when required.
- Internal research notes must not become public content without editorial conversion.
- Conflicting sources must be flagged rather than silently resolved.
- Primary sources and reputable archives are preferred over derivative summaries.
- Public-domain assumptions must be reviewed, not guessed.

## Required provenance metadata

All fields in `docs/reference/website/lou-gehrig-content-metadata-schema.md`
apply. Provenance-specific requirements:

| Field group | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Source identity | `source_title`, `source_citation`, and `source_url` when durable |
| Source authority | `source_owner` must identify publisher, archive, or rights holder |
| Retrieval context | `acquisition_method`, `date_accessed` |
| Confidence | `provenance_confidence`, `factual_confidence` |
| Attribution | `credit_line` required for every candidate |

## Credit display rules

| Scenario | Credit requirement |
| --- | --- |
| LGFC-owned media | Credit line may state LGFC ownership; document acquisition |
| Public archive citation | Credit archive name and catalog identifier |
| Licensed or permission-granted | Credit per license terms; retain permission record in notes |
| Link-only / reference-only | Credit may point to source URL; no full reproduction |
| User submission | Credit submitter only when approved; separate source credit for underlying material |
| Unknown rights | No public credit until rights review completes |

Credit lines must be human-readable and suitable for future public display on
website surfaces (homepage, library, gallery, timeline).

## Contributor and researcher records

| Role | Evidence retained |
| --- | --- |
| Operator researcher | Reviewer name, review date, intake notes |
| Member submitter | Submission path, submitter ID (internal), submission timestamp |
| External institution contact | Institution name, contact reference, response date in notes |
| ChatGPT/Bill escalation | Escalation reason and decision in notes |

Researcher identity is retained for audit; public pages display source credit,
not internal researcher notes, unless editorially approved.

## Evidence retention

Retain for the life of the candidate record:

- source citation and access date;
- rights status history (in notes when status changes);
- review decisions and reviewer identity;
- rejection or defer reasons;
- permission documentation references (external to repo when sensitive);
- conflicting-source flags and resolution notes.

Do not store paywalled full text, scraped social content, or unlicensed media
binaries in the repository.

## Conflicting sources

When two or more sources disagree on a fact:

1. Flag the candidate notes with `conflict: true` and list sources.
2. Set `factual_confidence` to `low` until resolved.
3. Do not publish interpretive resolution without editor approval.
4. Prefer primary sources; document why a source was chosen if editorially approved.
5. Alternate perspectives may become non-canonical inventory rows per content
   inventory model; do not silently overwrite canonical facts.

Escalate unresolved conflicts to Bill/ChatGPT before public-copy approval.

## Relationship to unified workflow

Provenance capture at research intake aligns with `submission_queue` source fields
and `content_inventory` publication requirements. Research candidates that
promote to public copy must satisfy both this model and
`docs/reference/website/content-inventory-model.md`.

## Acceptance checklist

- [x] Provenance fields documented
- [x] Source-credit rules documented
- [x] Contributor/researcher evidence handling documented
- [x] Conflicting-source handling documented
