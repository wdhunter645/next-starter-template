# CLOUDFLARE — Resource Inventory (LGFC)

This document is the **supporting Cloudflare resource inventory** under the Platform and Environment Domain Policy (`docs/governance/PLATFORM-AND-ENVIRONMENT.md`).

It captures what currently exists in Cloudflare for the LGFC deployment (design + resource inventory only).

This file is **not** a Domain Policy co-owner. Conflicts with domain policy, Product Authority decisions, or other supporting specs resolve through `docs/governance/PLATFORM-AND-ENVIRONMENT.md`.
