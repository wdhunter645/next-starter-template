# PR Process Metrics

## Purpose

Lightweight measurement for PR-process rebuild validation. Metrics are recorded after merge via `OPS — PR Process Metrics` and the `scripts/ci/pr_process_metrics.mjs` helper.

## Tracked checks

- `quality` — required
- `gitleaks` — required
- `pr-hygiene` — advisory
- `diff-scope` — advisory
- `reviewer-response-completion` — advisory

## Recorded fields

- `firstPassSuccess` — all tracked checks pass on run attempt 1
- `secondPassSuccess` — all tracked checks pass on run attempt 2
- `requiredChecksGreen` — required checks pass regardless of advisory noise
- `failedRequiredChecks` — deterministic blockers that failed
- `failedAdvisoryChecks` — advisory gates that failed without blocking merge

## Collection

1. Automatic: `ops-pr-process-metrics.yml` on merged PR close events.
2. Manual: workflow dispatch with a PR number for probe validation.

Artifacts: `pr-process-metrics.json` and `pr-process-metrics.md`.

## Operator rule

Use metrics to decide whether advisory gates are ready for promotion. Do not promote a gate to required until it shows low-noise advisory behavior across several PRs.
