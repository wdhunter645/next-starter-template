# Claude Code Wake Contract

## Purpose

Give the repository a deterministic, automated way to alert Claude Code /
Engineering about work that needs attention, instead of relying on someone
typing an `@claude` mention by hand. This mirrors the existing
`cursor-local-wake.yml` delivery-only pattern (`docs/reference/ci/cursor-local-bridge-contract.md`)
but for Claude Code, and with a materially smaller footprint: there is no
local daemon to keep alive, so the workflow runs on a standard
GitHub-hosted runner and its only side effect is a comment.

## What this is not

This workflow is **delivery only**. It does not:

- prove a Claude Code session actually picked up the work;
- grant approval, merge, or execution authority;
- replace the source Issue/PR as the authority for scope and decisions;
- guarantee any particular backend automatically starts a session on
  `@claude` mentions — that depends on account/platform-level integration
  this repository does not configure. Worst case if no such integration is
  listening, the comment is still a durable, greppable signal that a
  polling Claude Code session (or a human) can search for.

## Triggers

| Trigger | Condition | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pull_request` | `opened`, `reopened`, or `ready_for_review`; the PR is not a draft; and the head repo is this repo (not a fork) | Alert comment on the PR |
| `issue_comment` | Created on an open **issue** (not a PR) by `wdhunter645`, with a body starting with `CLAUDE CODE RESUME` | Alert comment on the issue |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual, restricted to `github.actor == 'wdhunter645'` | Alert comment on the given issue/PR number |

Every PR eventually needs PR Approver / Engineering review, so the `pull_request`
trigger covers that class without requiring a label. Issue-side routing
uses a resume marker rather than a dedicated label, keeping this bounded to
the two use cases that currently exist. (Cursor Local Bridge dropped its
equivalent comment marker in favor of labels/status only — #3013 — but that
change is scoped to the Bridge; this workflow's own `CLAUDE CODE RESUME`
trigger is unaffected.)

The fork and comment-author restrictions exist because this is a write
path: a fork PR's `pull_request` event only gets a read-only token
regardless of the `permissions:` block (so an unrestricted fork trigger
would just fail red on external contributors' PRs), and an unrestricted
`issue_comment` trigger would let anyone force a write by posting the
resume marker on any open issue.

## Comment markers

- `CLAUDE CODE WAKE: delivered` — the alert comment this workflow posts.
  Includes a delivery id and the triggering event name.
- `CLAUDE CODE RESUME` — the issue-side marker that requests a wake alert
  for Engineering. It exists solely to trigger this delivery workflow and
  is unrelated to Cursor Local Bridge, which (as of #3013) does not parse
  any comment marker at all — Bridge eligibility is labels/status only
  (`scripts/cursor-bridge/lib/eligibility.mjs`).

## Deduplication

Before posting, the workflow lists existing comments on the target and
skips delivery if one already contains the line `CLAUDE CODE WAKE:
delivered` (the alert body leads with `@claude` so the marker is not the
first line — the check matches it anywhere in the comment, not only at the
start). This keeps `reopened` and repeated manual dispatch from spamming
the thread.

## Former gap, now resolved (#3013)

This section previously described a naming-rule violation: the Bridge
eligibility contract's response-marker vocabulary (`CHATGPT RESPONSE`,
`CHATGPT CLOSEOUT`) hardcoded a vendor/product name rather than the durable
`PMO / Engineering` role. #3013 removed comment-marker parsing from the
Bridge eligibility contract entirely — there is no vocabulary left to rename
or hardcode. Bridge eligibility is decided from Issue labels/status only.

## Verification

Changes to the workflow are validated for YAML correctness and against the
CI header check before merge; validation evidence for a given change is
recorded on the PR, not in this reference document.
