# PR Process Current State

## Status

The repository PR-process redesign is complete in code and workflow disposition.

Current principles:

- stable-facts PR bodies only;
- GitHub-native reviewer lifecycle;
- deterministic required checks;
- advisory-first promotion;
- single-owner post-merge closeout;
- routine incremental exception housekeeping;
- no dedicated #1075 CI phase-generation engine.

## Required operator confirmation

Before merging #2469, verify live branch protection for `main` requires only:

- `quality`
- `gitleaks`

Remove retired check names if still configured.

## Required checks

| Job | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| `quality` | `gate-quality.yml` |
| `gitleaks` | `gitleaks.yml` |

## Active advisory checks

| Job | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| `pr-hygiene` | `gate-pr-hygiene.yml` |
| `diff-scope` | `gate-diff-scope.yml` |
| `reviewer-response-completion` | `reviewer-response-completion.yml` |

## Manual-only / rebuild later

| Workflow | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `gate-intent-labeler.yml` | Manual-only |
| `ops-pr-issue-accounting.yml` | Manual-only |
| `gate-drift.yml` | Manual-only |
| `gate-branch-freshness.yml` | Manual-only |
| `docs-guardrails.yml` | Manual-only |
| `design-compliance-warn.yml` | Manual-only |
| `gate-post-merge-readiness.yml` | Manual backfill only |

## Post-merge and metrics

| Workflow | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `post-merge-closeout.yml` | Single automatic closeout owner |
| `post-merge-remediation.yml` | Failure support |
| `ops-post-merge-self-healing.yml` | Scheduled/manual exception hygiene |
| `ops-pr-process-metrics.yml` | Metrics |

## #1075 retirement

#2469 removes the old scheduled phase engine, fixed state file, orphaned decomposition assets, and legacy workflow residue. Historical #1075 phase issues do not block or authorize current CI work.

The remaining exception queue is handled incrementally through routine housekeeping rather than a new large remediation program.

## Do not promote without evidence

Do not promote advisory gates to required status or restore PR-body lifecycle mutation without satisfying `/docs/governance/PR_PROCESS.md`.
