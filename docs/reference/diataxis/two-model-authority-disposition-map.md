# Two-Model Authority Disposition Map

## Purpose

Record the authority disposition for every canonical document touched by issue #2486 and the related agent-policy placement conflict. No document may be moved or archived until its row is complete and references are updated.

## Disposition actions

| Action | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| retain | Keep path; update content and references only |
| consolidate | Merge into another canonical path; supersede source |
| migrate | Move content to a new canonical path in a later child issue |
| archive | Move to `docs/archive/**` when historical retention is required |
| supersede | Mark inactive; remove active routing in touched set |

## Touched documents (#2486 allowlist)

| Current path | Current owner | Target owner | Action | Replacement / notes | Reference-update scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/governance/REPOSITORY-AUTHORITY.md` | — | Constitution (Layer 0) | retain (new) | This file is the new constitution | `Agent.md`, architecture docs, inventory map |
| `docs/governance/standards/document-authority-hierarchy_MASTER.md` | Governance | Documentation and Knowledge | supersede | Competing canonical precedence removed; file is a superseded pointer to `REPOSITORY-AUTHORITY.md` until archived | Self, `DOCUMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `docs/governance/DOCUMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Governance | Documentation and Knowledge | retain | Reconcile `docs/ops/ai/` binding-policy claim with DIATAXIS ops prohibition | All paths citing ops/ai as binding policy owner |
| `docs/governance/standards/DIATAXIS-FOLDER-AUTHORITY.md` | Documentation and Knowledge | Documentation and Knowledge | retain | Align ops prohibition with agent routing table in constitution | `DOCUMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md`, resolution doc |
| `docs/governance/standards/DIATAXIS-AUTHORITY-RESOLUTION.md` | Documentation and Knowledge | Documentation and Knowledge | retain | Add constitution precedence above resolution rules | Inventory map, architecture |
| `docs/reference/diataxis/authority-inventory-and-routing-map.md` | Documentation and Knowledge | Documentation and Knowledge | retain | Point Layer 0 to `REPOSITORY-AUTHORITY.md` | Intro and authority layers section |

## Agent-policy placement conflict (cross-cutting)

Binding material currently under `docs/ops/ai/` conflicts with DIATAXIS ops folder rules (`ops/` prohibited: authority, system definitions).

| Current path | Current owner | Target owner | Action | Replacement / notes | Program child |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/ops/ai/SHARED-AGENT-RULES.md` | ops/ai (incorrect for binding policy) | Agent Team governance | migrate | `docs/governance/AGENT-TEAM.md` or split policy index (Task 4) | Task 4 #2486 follow-on |
| `docs/ops/ai/CORE-RULES.md` | ops/ai | Agent Team governance | migrate | Consolidate into governance agent policy (Task 4) | Task 4 |
| `docs/ops/ai/CURSOR-RULES.md` | ops/ai | Agent Team governance + reference | migrate | Binding rules → governance; execution facts remain reference-adjacent | Task 4 |
| `docs/ops/ai/chatgpt-cursor-handoff-workflow.md` | Operations | Operations (procedure) | retain | Procedure stays under ops; constitution links as related | — |
| `docs/how-to/cursor/github-poll-wake-loop.md` | Operations procedure | Operations procedure | retain | Local runtime procedure; linked from runtime routing standard | — |
| `docs/governance/standards/CURSOR-RUNTIME-ROUTING.md` | Agent Team governance | Agent Team governance | retain | Already in correct layer from #2489 | — |

Until Task 4 migration completes, legacy `docs/ops/ai/` binding files remain **interim authoritative** for agent execution. New binding policy must not be added under `docs/ops/ai/`.

## Domain policy disposition

| Domain | Canonical policy path | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product and Design | `docs/governance/PRODUCT-AND-DESIGN.md` | Introduced by #2687 and activated through integrated reconciliation #2690 |
| PMO and Portfolio | `docs/governance/PMO-PORTFOLIO.md` | Active canonical owner |
| Delivery and Release | `docs/governance/DELIVERY-AND-RELEASE.md` | Active canonical owner |
| Agent Team | `docs/governance/AGENT-TEAM.md` | Active canonical owner |
| CI and Verification | `docs/governance/CI-AND-VERIFICATION.md` | Introduced by #2689 and activated through integrated reconciliation #2690 |
| Operations and Recovery | `docs/governance/OPERATIONS-AND-RECOVERY.md` | Active canonical owner |
| Platform and Environment | `docs/governance/PLATFORM-AND-ENVIRONMENT.md` | Introduced by #2688 and activated through integrated reconciliation #2690 |

## Validation checklist (#2486)

- [x] Every touched allowlist row has target owner and action recorded
- [x] Agent-policy conflict documented with interim authority noted
- [x] Every required domain names exactly one canonical policy file in `REPOSITORY-AUTHORITY.md`
- [x] `document-authority-hierarchy_MASTER.md` no longer carries competing canonical precedence
- [x] No duplicate active authority introduced in touched set
- [x] Direct references updated within touched documents
- [x] Header checks pass on modified files (local run)
