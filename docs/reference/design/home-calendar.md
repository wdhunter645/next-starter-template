# Homepage Section Spec — Calendar

## Purpose
Define the homepage calendar section that previews near-term Fan Club events.

## Route / Path
- Host page: `/`
- Section anchor/id: `#calendar`

## Section / Component Breakdown
- Section wrapper in `src/app/page.tsx`
- Component owner: `src/components/CalendarSection.tsx`
- Styles owner: `src/components/CalendarSection.module.css`

## Data Dependencies
- Event data via calendar/event APIs consumed by `CalendarSection`.
- Uses deterministic fallback entries if live data is unavailable.

## Auth / Access Expectations
- Publicly visible section.
- No sign-in required for read access.

## Key UX / Behavior Notes
- Calendar grid + detail panel behavior must remain stable on desktop/mobile.
- Section communicates loading/error/empty states without collapsing layout.
