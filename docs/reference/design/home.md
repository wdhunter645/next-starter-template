# Homepage Layout

The homepage uses a fixed canonical section order.

---

# Homepage Canonical Section Order

1. HEADER
2. BANNER
3. SPOTLIGHT (hidden by default)
4. WEEKLY MATCHUP
5. JOIN
6. ABOUT
7. SOCIAL
8. DISCUSSIONS
9. FRIENDS
10. MILESTONES
11. CALENDAR
12. FAQ/ASK
13. FOOTER

When spotlight is inactive, position #3 remains a hidden slot; the locked sequence still governs the page contract.

## Planned Extraction Mapping (non-blocking)

The following sections are currently implemented inline in `src/app/page.tsx` and may be extracted later for consistency; this is planning guidance, not a statement that files already exist.

- Hero Banner → planned `src/components/home/HeroBanner.tsx`
- About Lou Gehrig → planned `src/components/home/AboutLouGehrigSection.tsx`
