# `/health` — Health Route Specification

## Purpose
Define a lightweight route used to verify baseline app routing/runtime availability.

## Route / Path
- Canonical route: `/health`
- Read-only diagnostics route.

## Section / Component Breakdown
- Health response view: `src/app/health/page.tsx`
- Displays static OK marker plus server-rendered timestamp.

## Data Dependencies
- No external data dependency.
- Uses runtime timestamp generation at render time.

## Auth / Access Expectations
- Public route.
- Must not require member authentication.
- Must not leak privileged configuration or secrets.

## Key UX / Behavior Notes
- Output is intentionally plain/minimal and machine-check-friendly.
- Route is diagnostic; it is not part of primary site navigation.
