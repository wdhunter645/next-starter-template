# Lou Gehrig Fan Club — MemberPage Specification (v1)

This document defines the **memberpage** — the default landing page shown immediately after a successful member login.

- Route / purpose: "MemberPage" (canonical name: `memberpage`)
- Audience: Authenticated members only
- Role: Primary home hub for all member-only activity, content creation, and navigation into deeper archives and tools

This spec follows the same standard as the homepage:
- Versioned spec file: `docs/memberpage-v1.html`
- Canonical alias: `docs/memberpage.html` (always a copy of the latest versioned spec)

---

## 1. Global Structure and Section Order

The MemberPage must present the following sections **in this order**:

1. Header  
2. Welcome Section  
3. Post Creation / Work Area  
4. Member Discussion Feed  
5. Archives Tiles (Photo Gallery, Memorabilia Archive, Library)  
6. Gehrig Timeline  
7. Admin Dashboard Link (conditional, admins only)  

The Profile Page is a **separate view** (linked from MemberPage), not a section rendered inline.

---

## 2. Header

**Purpose:** Provide consistent navigation and quick access to main areas.

**Contents:**

- **Logo (left):**
  - Lou Gehrig Fan Club logo
  - Clicking logo returns to MemberPage

- **Right-side controls:**
  - `Login` / `Logout` button (for MemberPage, this will typically render as `Logout`)
  - Hamburger menu with nested items:
    - `About`
    - `Contact`
    - `Store`
    - `Members` (current app; can indicate "You are here")
    - `Admin` (visible only for admins/mods)

**Behavior notes:**

- Header layout should match overall LGFC design language (shared with public site where practical).
- On MemberPage, logged-in users should see a clear `Logout` option.
- `Admin` menu item must only render for accounts listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS`.

### Logo & Nav Behavior (Member Area)

- On all **member-only pages** (MemberPage and member-only spokes), the logo:
  - Links to `/memberpage`
  - Returns to the top of MemberPage.
- Member nav must include:
  - `Home` → `/` (public homepage)
  - `Members` → `/memberpage`
  - `Admin` (if user is admin) → `/admin`

**Important:**
- Members should never feel "trapped" in the member area; there must always be a clear path back to the public homepage.

### Admin Nav Behavior

Admin dashboard header uses **text links**, not the site logo:
- Admin dashboard must always provide:
  - `Home` → `/` (public homepage)
  - `Member` → `/memberpage` (MemberPage)
- Admin pages are considered part of the member/admin context; they share the same overall navigation model, but the logo can be hidden to simplify and emphasize explicit links.

---

## 3. Welcome Section

**Purpose:** Personalized greeting and quick snapshot of what's happening, immediately reassuring the member they are "inside" the club.

**Contents:**

- **Heading:**  
  - `Welcome back, [Name]`  
    - `[Name]` is the member's known display name; if not available, use screen_name or email.

- **Subtext:**  
  - A short, static welcome line, for example:  
    - `Here's what's new around the club in the last 30 days.`

- **Profile link:**  
  - Text link or button: `View Profile` or `Profile Page`
  - Clicking this opens the member's Profile Page (see separate spec), which lives as `memberID#.html` or an equivalent unique route.
  - The Profile Page allows:
    - Viewing contributions summary
    - Updating name, email, and screen name

- **Upcoming events summary (30-day window):**
  - A concise list of upcoming events within the next 30 days, pulled from the same events data used by the public homepage calendar.
  - Example:
    - `Next 30 days:`
      - `Dec 15 — Annual Lou Gehrig Memorial Event`
      - `Jan 8 — Virtual Q&A with Baseball Historians`
  - If no events exist in the next 30 days, show a simple message such as:  
    - `No upcoming events in the next 30 days. Check the Calendar for more.`

**Behavior notes:**

- Email changes initiated from the Profile Page must re-trigger the magic-link verification process before updating the stored email.
- Welcome section is the **anchor** of memberpage and must be visually prominent.

---

## 4. Post Creation / Work Area

**Purpose:** Let members create new posts and start discussions — "What's on your mind?" area.

**Section label (visible):**

- `Share with the Club` or equivalent copy; main placeholder text:
  - `What's on your mind?`

**Required elements:**

- **Text input** (textarea) for the post body (required).
- **Attachment control(s)**:
  - Allow attaching at least one photo or video (B2-backed media; details in separate media spec).
- **Post visibility note:**
  - Short line clarifying that posts are visible to other members only.
- **Submit button:**
  - `Post` or similar label.

**Rules:**

- Top-level posts must have:
  - Non-empty text
  - At least one attached photo/video if the spec requires it.
- Replies can be text-only with optional attachment (see Discussion Feed).
- On successful submission:
  - Post appears at the top of the Member Discussion Feed.
  - Any validation or errors must be clearly indicated.

---

## 5. Member Discussion Feed

**Purpose:** The central space where members' posts and discussions appear (a Facebook-like stream).

**Section heading:**

- `Member Discussion` or `Club Discussion`

**Contents:**

- **Post list:**  
  - Reverse chronological feed (newest at the top).
  - Each post includes:
    - Author display name (or screen_name if no name is provided)
    - Timestamp
    - Text content
    - Attached media (photo/video thumbnails)
    - Aggregated reactions and reports

- **Replies:**
  - Nested or threaded under each post.
  - Each reply includes:
    - Author
    - Timestamp
    - Text
    - Optional attachment

- **Controls on each post and reply:**
  - `Like`
  - `Dislike`
  - `Report` button

**Report behavior:**

- Every `Report` action sends an entry into a unified moderation queue.
- All reported content (posts and replies) must appear in the Admin Dashboard "Reports" view, with:
  - Item type (post or comment)
  - Snippet of content
  - Reporter info
  - Count of reports
  - Status (open/reviewed/dismissed)

**Notes:**

- Member Discussion Feed is read/write for members.
- The eventual "Recent Club Activity" section on the public homepage will draw from this feed (read-only subset).

---

## 6. Archives Tiles Section

**Purpose:** Provide a visual hub linking to rich archives and collections.

**Section heading:**

- `Archives` or `Explore the Archives`

**Layout:**

- **Three horizontally-aligned tiles** (or a responsive grid that stacks on mobile):

  1. **Memorabilia Archive**
     - Tile text: `Memorabilia Archive`
     - Description: `Browse member-curated memorabilia and artifacts.`
     - On click: routes to the Memorabilia Archive view.

  2. **Photo Gallery**
     - Tile text: `Photo Gallery`
     - Description: `Explore photos from Gehrig's life, career, and fan collections.`
     - On click: routes to the Gallery view.

  3. **Library**
     - Tile text: `Library`
     - Description: `Read articles, books, clippings, and historical references.`
     - On click: routes to the Library view.

**Behavior notes:**

- These tiles are **fully clickable**.
- Backed by B2 media + Supabase metadata (see media/table specifications).
- The same Archive sections may have public "teaser" versions on the homepage; MemberPage sees the full member-only versions.

---

## 7. Gehrig Timeline

**Purpose:** Provide a member-focused, richer version of Gehrig's life and career timeline.

**Section heading:**

- `Gehrig Timeline` or equivalent

**Content:**

- More detailed than the public Milestones section; can include:
  - Additional events and intermediate years
  - Photos or document links
  - Deeper descriptions

**Behavior notes:**

- This section can start as a static timeline mirroring the public milestones and expand over time.
- It should be easy to scroll and scan; no complex interactivity is required initially.

---

## 8. Admin Dashboard Link (Conditional)

**Purpose:** Give administrators and moderators quick access to tools.

**Visibility:**

- Only visible to users whose email is in `ADMIN_EMAILS`.

**Section format:**

- Simple section at bottom of MemberPage:

  - Heading: `Admin Tools`
  - Button or link: `Go to Admin Dashboard`

**Destination:**

- Routes to the Admin Dashboard (separate view/spec), which includes:
  - Reports list (all reported content, unified)
  - Moderation actions (hide/delete/warn)
  - Media tagging tools, etc. (future)

---

## 9. Profile Page (Linked, Not Inline)

The Profile Page is not rendered as part of the MemberPage, but this spec defines the expectations for the link behavior:

**Trigger:**

- From the Welcome Section: `View Profile` / `Profile Page` link.

**Required Profile Page features:**

- Display:
  - Member name
  - Email
  - Screen name
  - Summary of contributions (posts, comments, etc.)
- Edit functions:
  - Change name
  - Change screen name
  - Change email (requires new magic-link verification before update)
- Identity rule:
  - Screen name defaults to email if one is not specified.

---

## 10. Versioning and Canonical Rules

- This file is the **v1 snapshot**:  
  - `docs/memberpage-v1.html`

- The **canonical, current standard** file is:
  - `docs/memberpage.html`

- When v1 is adopted as the live standard:
  - `docs/memberpage.html` must be a **byte-for-byte copy** of this file at that point in time.

- Future updates:
  - `memberpage-v2.html`, `memberpage-v3.html`, etc. will be created by copying the previous version and revising as needed.
  - `memberpage.html` will always be a copy of the latest versioned file.

---

## 11. Required Version Remark
