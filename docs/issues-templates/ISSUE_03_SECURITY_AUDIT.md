# Verify Security Incident Remediation

**Labels:** `security`, `audit`, `high-priority`  
**Parent Issue:** #{PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER}

---

## Problem Statement

On October 16, 2025, a .env file containing 18 secrets was accidentally committed to the repository (commit 525b5ad) and subsequently removed. While removal and documentation were completed, there is no verification that all exposed credentials have been rotated.

### Security Incident Summary

**Exposed File:** `.env` (18 secrets)  
**Commit Hash:** 525b5ad  
**Exposure Duration:** Unknown (until removal)  
**Remediation Docs:** docs/SECURITY_NOTICE.md created  
**Status:** Removal complete, rotation verification needed

### Potentially Exposed Credentials

Based on .env.example, the following credential types were likely exposed:

1. **GitHub Personal Access Token** (GITHUB_TOKEN)
2. **Supabase Credentials**
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
3. **Cloudflare Credentials**
   - CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
   - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
4. **Deployment Tokens**
   - CF_PAGES_COMMIT_SHA
   - VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA (if used)
5. **Application Secrets**
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
   - SESSION_SECRET (if exists)
6. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_ELFSIGHT_WIDGET_ID (not sensitive)
   - Other API keys

- [ ] Non-sensitive values (URLs, public IDs) marked as safe
- [ ] All GitHub repository secrets updated
- [ ] All Cloudflare secrets updated
- [ ] All Supabase credentials regenerated
- [ ] Security audit report documented
- [ ] Incident closure signed off by repository owner

## Proposed Solution

### Security Audit Checklist

Create comprehensive checklist covering:

1. **GitHub Credentials**
   - [ ] PAT rotated (all team members)
   - [ ] Repository secrets updated
   - [ ] Workflow secrets verified

2. **Supabase Credentials**
   - [ ] New project keys generated
   - [ ] Service role key rotated
   - [ ] Anon key rotated
   - [ ] Database passwords changed (if applicable)

3. **Cloudflare Credentials**
   - [ ] API token regenerated
   - [ ] Account verified for unauthorized access
   - [ ] Workers secrets updated

4. **Deployment Environment**
   - [ ] Production environment variables updated
   - [ ] Staging environment variables updated
   - [ ] Local .env.example verified (no secrets)

5. **Third-Party Services**
   - [ ] Identify all API keys exposed
   - [ ] Verify which services support key rotation
   - [ ] Rotate or monitor each service

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

1. **Unknown exposure duration** - Can't determine how long secrets were public
   - Mitigation: Assume worst case, rotate all credentials
2. **Incomplete rotation** - Some services might be missed
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive checklist, multiple reviews
3. **Service disruption** - Rotating credentials might break deployed app
   - Mitigation: Coordinate with owner, rotate during maintenance window
4. **Cascading dependencies** - One credential might unlock others
   - Mitigation: Review all interconnected services

### Assumptions

1. Repository owner has access to all credential sources
2. All services support credential rotation
3. No unauthorized access has occurred (best case)
4. Documentation in SECURITY_NOTICE.md is accurate

## Checklist of Deliverables

- [ ] Create docs/security/INCIDENT_2025-10-16_AUDIT.md
- [ ] Document all 18 exposed credential types
- [ ] Create verification checklist with status tracking
- [ ] Execute rotation for each credential (coordinate with owner)
- [ ] Document rotation completion dates
- [ ] Update .env.example with new credential guidance
- [ ] Add credential rotation section to docs/CREDENTIAL_ROTATION.md (new)
- [ ] Create GitHub issue comment with audit results

---

## A→G Acceptance Criteria

### A) Preconditions verified
- [ ] docs/SECURITY_NOTICE.md reviewed and understood
- [ ] .env.example reviewed for all credential types
- [ ] Access confirmed to all services requiring rotation
- [ ] Repository owner available for coordination
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled (if needed for production)

### B) Implementation steps executed
- [ ] Security audit document created
- [ ] All credential types identified and catalogued
- [ ] Checklist populated with specific items
- [ ] Rotation coordination with owner
- [ ] Each credential rotated and verified
- [ ] New credentials updated in all environments
- [ ] Deployment tested with new credentials

### C) Repo health checks pass
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] No credentials in code or docs (scan with trufflehog if available)

### D) Minimal e2e verification complete
- [ ] Production deployment works with new credentials
- [ ] All integrations (Supabase, Cloudflare) functional
- [ ] No authentication errors in logs
- [ ] Test push/pull operations with new GitHub tokens

**Verification commands:**
```bash
# Verify no secrets in tracked files
git grep -E "(sk_|pk_|api_key|secret|token|password)" -- ':!.env.example' ':!docs/'

# Check environment is set
echo "Verify production env has new values"

# Test application functionality
npm run build
npm run preview
# Visit application, test all features
```

### E) Artifacts updated
- [ ] docs/security/INCIDENT_2025-10-16_AUDIT.md created
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with incident resolution
- [ ] README.md security notice updated (mark as resolved)
- [ ] New CREDENTIAL_ROTATION.md guide created

### F) Link PR(s) and reference parent
- [ ] PR opened with "Closes #{this_issue_number}"
- [ ] PR references parent issue #{PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER}
- [ ] PR description includes:
  - List of credentials rotated
  - Verification status for each
  - Services confirmed functional
  - Audit report summary

### G) Close with post-implementation note
**What changed:**
- Audited all 18 exposed credentials
- Rotated X sensitive credentials
- Verified Y credentials as non-sensitive (public IDs)
- Updated all deployment environments
- Created credential rotation runbook

**How to verify:**
- Review audit report: docs/security/INCIDENT_2025-10-16_AUDIT.md
- Check all services functional in production
- Verify no authentication errors in logs
- Confirm .env.example has no secrets

**Ongoing monitoring:**
- Monitor services for unusual activity for 30 days
- Review access logs for unauthorized attempts
- Set up alerts for credential usage anomalies (if available)

**Rollback process:**
- N/A - Security changes are not reversible
- If issues arise, refer to credential rotation runbook
- Contact service support for emergency access recovery

## Implementation Notes

### Audit Report Template

```markdown
# Security Incident Audit Report
Date: 2025-10-17
Incident: .env file exposure (commit 525b5ad)
Auditor: [Name]

## Credentials Audited

| Credential | Type | Rotation Status | Date | Verified By |
|------------|------|-----------------|------|-------------|
| GITHUB_TOKEN | Secret | ✅ Rotated | 2025-10-17 | @owner |
| SUPABASE_ANON_KEY | Secret | ✅ Rotated | 2025-10-17 | @owner |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Summary
- Total credentials: 18
- Sensitive credentials: X
- Rotated: X
- Non-sensitive (public): Y
- Monitoring: Z

## Recommendations
1. Enable GitHub secret scanning
2. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent .env commits
3. Implement credential rotation schedule (90 days)
4. Add security audit to quarterly review
```

### Coordination with Owner

This issue requires close coordination with @wdhunter645:
1. Schedule 30-minute session to review credentials
2. Provide checklist in advance
3. Rotate together to ensure no service disruption
4. Document each rotation with timestamp

### Tools for Detection

```bash
# Scan for accidentally committed secrets
# Install trufflehog: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog
trufflehog filesystem . --only-verified

# GitHub native secret scanning (if enabled)
# Check: https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/security/secret-scanning

# Search for potential secrets
git log -p -S 'password' -S 'secret' -S 'token'
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (includes coordination time)  
**Priority:** High (Security)  
**Dependency:** Requires repository owner involvement  
**Sensitive:** Yes - Coordinate privately with owner before creating public issue
