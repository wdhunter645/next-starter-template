# Archive After-Action Reports

**Labels:** `cleanup`, `docs`, `high-priority`  
**Parent Issue:** #{PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER}

---

## Problem Statement

The repository root directory contains 7 after-action completion report files that clutter the workspace and create confusion about what work is current vs. historical.

### Current State

**After-Action Reports in Root:**
1. IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md (248 lines)
2. DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md (58 lines)
3. ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md (330 lines)
4. SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md (175 lines)
5. ISSUE_31_COMPLETE.md (60 lines)
6. ISSUE_34_COMPLETE.md (127 lines)
7. DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md (if exists)

**Additional Report Files:**
- FEATURES.md (features tracker)
- LGFC-*.md files (project-specific docs)

### Problems

1. **Root directory clutter** - Hard to find current working docs
2. **Confusion about status** - Are these issues still open?
3. **Historical value** - Reports have useful lessons but wrong location
4. **Discoverability** - New contributors don't know what's historical

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All after-action reports moved to docs/archive/
- [ ] Archive directory has README.md index
- [ ] Key lessons extracted to CHANGELOG.md or project wiki
- [ ] Root directory < 10 .md files
- [ ] No broken links from existing docs to archived files
- [ ] Archive README explains purpose and organization

---

## Proposed Solution

### Create Archive Structure

```
/
├── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── SECRETS_SETUP.md
├── FEATURES.md (keep - active tracker)
├── CHANGELOG.md (enhanced with lessons)
│
└── docs/
    ├── archive/
    │   ├── README.md (NEW - Archive index)
    │   ├── 2025-10-16-implementation-complete.md
    │   ├── 2025-10-16-devcontainer-removal.md
    │   ├── 2025-10-16-issues-complete.md
    │   ├── 2025-10-16-solution-delivered.md
    │   ├── 2025-10-16-issue-31-complete.md
    │   └── 2025-10-16-issue-34-complete.md

```

### Archive README Template

```markdown
# Project Archive

Historical completion reports and after-action documentation.

## October 2025 - MVP Completion Sprint

### Implementation Reports
- [Implementation Complete](2025-10-16-implementation-complete.md) - Codespaces permissions configuration
- [Devcontainer Removal](2025-10-16-devcontainer-removal.md) - .devcontainer cleanup
- [Issues Complete](2025-10-16-issues-complete.md) - All 18 MVP issues resolved
- [Solution Delivered](2025-10-16-solution-delivered.md) - Terminal-only Git auth
- [Issue #31 Complete](2025-10-16-issue-31-complete.md) - Project organization
- [Issue #34 Complete](2025-10-16-issue-34-complete.md) - Feature enhancements

### Key Outcomes
- ✅ 18 MVP issues completed
- ✅ Security incident resolved (.env removal)
- ✅ Codespaces authentication fixed
- ✅ All routes and pages implemented

### Lessons Learned
1. Documentation needs regular consolidation
2. After-action reports valuable but should be archived
3. Security: Never commit .env files
4. Helper scripts improve developer experience
```

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks

1. **Broken links** - Other docs may reference these files
   - Mitigation: Search all docs for references, update links
2. **Loss of visibility** - Important info might be missed in archive
   - Mitigation: Extract key lessons to CHANGELOG or prominent docs
3. **Git history confusion** - File moves can complicate blame/history
   - Mitigation: Use `git mv` to preserve history

### Assumptions

1. Reports are historical and not actively referenced
2. Lessons learned can be extracted and documented elsewhere
3. Archive will be discoverable via docs/README.md

## Checklist of Deliverables

- [ ] Create docs/archive/ directory
- [ ] Create docs/archive/README.md with index and lessons
- [ ] Move 7 completion reports to archive (with date prefixes)
- [ ] Extract key lessons to CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Search codebase for references to moved files
- [ ] Update all links to archived files
- [ ] Update root README.md to mention archive (if relevant)
- [ ] Document archive structure in docs/README.md

---

## A→G Acceptance Criteria

### A) Preconditions verified
- [ ] All 7 completion reports identified and listed
- [ ] No open PRs modifying these files
- [ ] Git working tree clean
- [ ] Current root directory file count: X files

### B) Implementation steps executed
- [ ] docs/archive/ directory created
- [ ] Archive README.md created with index
- [ ] Files moved using `git mv` (preserves history)
- [ ] Date prefixes added (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- [ ] Key lessons extracted to CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] All references updated

### C) Repo health checks pass
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] No broken markdown links

### D) Minimal e2e verification complete
- [ ] Root directory listing verified: < 10 .md files
- [ ] docs/archive/README.md renders correctly on GitHub
- [ ] All archived files accessible via archive README
- [ ] Links to archived files work (if any remain)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md includes extracted lessons

**Commands to verify:**
```bash
# Count .md files in root
ls -1 *.md | wc -l

# Verify archive structure
tree docs/archive/

# Check for broken links (if tool available)
find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "COMPLETE.md" {} \;
```

### E) Artifacts updated

- [ ] PR references parent issue #{PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER}
- [ ] PR description includes:
  - List of files moved
  - New archive structure
  - Lessons extracted to CHANGELOG
  - Before/after root directory listing

### G) Close with post-implementation note
**What changed:**
- Moved 7 completion reports to docs/archive/
- Created archive index with navigation
- Extracted key lessons to CHANGELOG.md
- Cleaned up root directory (X → Y .md files)

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Root should have < 10 .md files
ls -1 *.md | wc -l

# Archive should have all reports
ls -1 docs/archive/*.md

# Reports should be findable
cat docs/archive/README.md
```

**Rollback process:**
```bash
# Restore files to root
git checkout HEAD~1 -- *.md

# Remove archive
rm -rf docs/archive/
```

## Implementation Notes

### File Renaming Convention

Use ISO date format for clarity:
- IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md → 2025-10-16-implementation-complete.md
- DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md → 2025-10-16-devcontainer-removal.md

### Lessons to Extract

From reports, extract:
1. **Security**: Never commit .env files
2. **Process**: After-action reports should be archived promptly  
3. **Documentation**: Consolidate overlapping guides regularly
4. **Codespaces**: Token configuration critical for git push
5. **Testing**: Build test infrastructure early

### Link Update Strategy

1. Search for references: `grep -r "COMPLETE.md" .`
2. Update each reference to new path
3. Consider keeping stubs with redirects (optional)

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependency:** None (can be done first)  
**Good First Issue:** Yes - Clear scope, low risk
