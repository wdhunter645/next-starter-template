# Operational Backlog from After-Action Reports

**Labels:** `ops`, `backlog`, `automation`

---

## Summary

After comprehensive review of all after-action reports (START_HERE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md, ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md, SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md, ISSUE_31_COMPLETE.md, ISSUE_34_COMPLETE.md), we have identified 10 actionable items to operationalize lessons learned and improve repository maintainability.

### Key Findings

- âœ… **18 MVP issues completed successfully** - Full feature set delivered
- âœ… **Security incident resolved** - .env file removed, credentials rotation documented  
- âœ… **Authentication issues fixed** - Terminal-only PAT workflow established
- ðŸ“‹ **Documentation needs consolidation** - 15+ overlapping guides create friction
- ðŸ“‹ **After-action reports need archival** - 7 completion files clutter root
- ðŸ“‹ **No test infrastructure** - Repository lacks automated testing

## Backlog Items (10 Total)

### High Priority - Production Critical

1. **Consolidate Documentation Architecture** - Merge 15+ overlapping docs into single source of truth
2. **Archive After-Action Reports** - Move 7 *_COMPLETE.md files to docs/archive/  
3. **Verify Security Incident Remediation** - Audit all 18 exposed credentials were rotated

### Medium Priority - Developer Experience

4. **Create Automated Test Infrastructure** - Add linting, type checking, and smoke tests
5. **Automate Production Deployment Verification** - Script to verify all routes post-deploy
6. **Configure External Services** - Set Elfsight widget ID and enable Cloudflare Analytics
7. **Standardize Helper Script Management** - Consolidate .sh files into scripts/ directory

### Low Priority - Optimization

8. **Document GitHub Actions First-Run Approval** - Guide for first-time contributors
9. **Create Credential Rotation Runbook** - Repeatable process for security incidents
10. **Enhance CI/CD Pipeline** - Add documentation linting and link validation
