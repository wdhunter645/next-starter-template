# Repository Cleanup Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Branch:** `chore/repo-cleanup-zip-artifacts`  
**Purpose:** Remove leftover ZIP artifacts and stray project folder; add repo structure invariant checks

---

## Summary

This PR performs a cleanup-only operation to remove dead artifacts from the repository root and adds a fail-fast structure check to prevent future repository structure regressions.

---

## Items Removed

### 1. ZIP Artifacts
The following ZIP files were present in the repository root and have been **removed**:

- `next-starter-template-main-updated.zip` (2.36 MB)
- `next-starter-template-main_UPDATED_v5.zip` (4.69 MB)

**Total disk space recovered:** ~7.05 MB

### 2. Stray Secondary Project Folder
The following directory was present in the repository root and has been **removed**:

- `damp-dream-81b5/` (entire directory tree)
  - Contained: package.json, tsconfig.json, wrangler.jsonc, src/index.ts
  - This was a secondary/duplicate Cloudflare Worker project structure

---

## New Structure Check Implementation

### Script Created
- **Location:** `scripts/check-repo-structure.mjs`
- **Purpose:** Enforce repository structure invariants to prevent regressions

### Invariants Enforced
The script performs the following checks:

1. ✅ **Package.json at root:** Ensures `package.json` exists at repository root
2. ✅ **Single package.json:** Verifies only one `package.json` at depth ≤ 2 (excluding `node_modules`)
3. ✅ **Single Next.js app root:** Ensures only one directory contains both `package.json` and `next.config.*`
4. ✅ **No nested wrapper folders:** Detects common bad unzip patterns (e.g., `next-starter-template-main/`)

### NPM Script Added
```json
"check:structure": "node scripts/check-repo-structure.mjs"
```

### CI Integration
Updated `.github/workflows/quality.yml` to run the structure check:
- Runs on all PRs and pushes to main
- Executes after `npm ci` and before typecheck
- Fails fast if structure violations detected

## Verification Results

### Repository Structure Check Output
```
======================================
Repo Structure Invariant Check
======================================

✓ Checking for package.json at repo root...
  ✓ Found package.json at root

✓ Scanning for package.json files (depth <= 2, excluding node_modules)...
  Found 1 package.json file(s):

    - package.json (depth: 0)

  ✓ Only one package.json found (expected)

✓ Checking for Next.js app roots (package.json + next.config.*)...
  Found 1 Next.js app root(s):

    - . (depth: 0)

  ✓ Single Next.js app root at repository root

✓ Checking for nested wrapper folders...
  ✓ No nested wrapper folders detected

======================================
Summary
======================================

✅ All repository structure checks PASSED
```

### Build Verification
```bash
npm ci         # ✅ SUCCESS (527 packages, 0 vulnerabilities)
npm run build  # ✅ SUCCESS (static export completed)
npm run lint   # ✅ SUCCESS (pre-existing warnings only)
npm run check:structure # ✅ SUCCESS (all checks passed)
```

## Cloudflare Configuration Changes

**NONE.** This PR does not modify any Cloudflare-related configuration:

- ✅ `wrangler.toml` - unchanged
- ✅ `_routes.json` - unchanged
- ✅ `functions/` - unchanged
- ✅ `next.config.ts` - unchanged (Cloudflare adapter settings preserved)

## Impact Analysis

### Changed Files
1. **Deleted:**
   - `next-starter-template-main-updated.zip`
   - `next-starter-template-main_UPDATED_v5.zip`
   - `damp-dream-81b5/` (entire directory)

2. **Modified:**
   - `.github/workflows/quality.yml` (added structure check step)
   - `package.json` (added `check:structure` script)

3. **Created:**
   - `scripts/check-repo-structure.mjs` (new invariant checker)
   - `docs/reports/2025-12-28-repo-cleanup.md` (this report)

### Deployment Impact
- **Risk Level:** Minimal
- **Functional Changes:** None (artifact removal only)
- **Build Process:** Unchanged
- **Cloudflare Pages Deploy:** No impact expected (GREEN deployment anticipated)

### Rollback Plan
If any unexpected issues occur:
1. Revert PR commit(s) via GitHub UI
2. Re-run Cloudflare Pages deployment
3. All removed files were artifacts; no functional code lost

---

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] Two ZIP files removed from repo (or confirmed not present) ✅
- [x] `damp-dream-81b5/` removed (or confirmed not present) ✅
- [x] `npm run check:structure` exists and passes ✅
- [x] CI gate ensures structure regression is caught ✅
- [x] Build passes ✅
- [x] Cloudflare Pages deploy will remain GREEN (no config changes) ✅

---

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor First Deployment:** While no functional changes were made, monitor the first Cloudflare Pages deployment post-merge
2. **Structure Check in Pre-commit Hook:** Consider adding `npm run check:structure` to git pre-commit hooks for local validation
3. **Periodic Artifact Cleanup:** Schedule quarterly reviews for similar cleanup opportunities

---

## Conclusion

All cleanup tasks completed successfully. Repository structure is now clean, and invariant checks are in place to prevent future regressions. No Cloudflare configuration was modified, ensuring deployment continuity.

**Status:** ✅ READY FOR MERGE
