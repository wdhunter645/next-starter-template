# PR Readiness and Merge Authority Control (#1723)

## Purpose

Reconcile PR process/governance docs for readiness, batch review, human review,
merge authority, and documentation authority levels under Program `#1719`
Model B construction on `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation`.

## Documentation authority levels

| Level | Surface | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project construction authority | `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` | Versioned authority for Program `#1719` construction and successor child execution |
| Repository-wide authority | `main` | Default authority for the whole repository |

Promotion rule: project-branch documentation becomes repository-wide authority only
through a Bill/ChatGPT-approved promotion PR to `main`. Use a separate early
documentation promotion only when another active workstream must consume the
updated rule before `#1719` finishes, then synchronize the project branch.

Governance-folder placement does **not** invent an intermediate human gate on
the component branch for Tasks `#1723` or `#1724`.

## Authority updates

| Document | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/governance/PR_PROCESS.md` | Documentation authority levels; merge/readiness matrix; removed obsolete `#1723`/`#1724` protected-review stop; batch-review rules |
| `docs/governance/PR_GOVERNANCE.md` | Merge-authority summary aligned to two-level docs model |
| `docs/governance/DELIVERY-AND-RELEASE.md` | Clarified governance-doc edits alone do not select `protected-change-review` |

## Checklist

- [x] `READY FOR REVIEW` ≠ merge authority for `main`
- [x] Bill/ChatGPT approve all merges/promotions to `main`
- [x] Non-`main` Model B / `component-auto-integration` allowed when source issue authorizes
- [x] `#1723` / `#1724` do **not** require an intermediate human gate merely for governance-doc edits on the component branch
- [x] Two documentation authority levels documented (component project vs `main`)
- [x] Batch review preserves one issue per PR and does not grant Cursor `main` merge authority
- [x] Cursor self-approval / self-merge prohibited
- [x] No new custom gates added
- [x] No automatic merge to `main` authorized

## Follow-up note (outside this PR allowlist)

`docs/reference/pmo/lgfc-cursor-execution-contract.md` and
`docs/ops/reports/cursor-continuation-contract-matrix-1722.md` still contain
older “protected governance `#1723`/`#1724`” phrasing from Task `#1722`. Clear
that residual wording in Task `#1724` (allowlist includes `docs/reference/pmo/**`
and `docs/ops/reports/**`).

## Out of scope

- Runtime / workflow YAML / CI scripts / package / website files
- Issue mutation
- Cursor approval or merge
- Automatic merge to `main`

## Successor

After this PR’s technical component integration succeeds, begin Task `#1724`
immediately under the same component-branch documentation model. Task `#1725`
remains completed and is skipped. Task `#1726` follows `#1724`.
