# Content Collection Documentation Audit and Dedup Plan (#2360)

## Purpose

Repository-grounded audit of staged Drive drafts under `_incoming/drive-drafts/content-collection/` against existing LGFC documentation authority.

This report is an **audit artifact for #2360**. It does **not** promote Drive drafts into Diataxis authority.

## Source basis

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Parent program | #2359 |
| Source issue | #2360 |
| Intake branch | `atlas/drive-draft-intake-2367` |
| Working branch | `cursor/2360-docs-audit-2e48` |
| Intake folder | `_incoming/drive-drafts/content-collection/` |
| Manifest | `_incoming/drive-drafts/content-collection/SOURCE-MANIFEST.md` |
| Phase | Phase 0 — documentation migration / enrichment / Diataxis placement planning only |

Intake rule (from intake README/manifest): staged `.docx` files and the retained ZIP are **non-authoritative source material only**.

## Validation evidence (2026-07-08)

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `bash scripts/ci/docs_check_headers.sh` | **FAIL** — pre-existing on intake branch: legacy handoff path reference; active workflow is `docs/ops/ai/chatgpt-cursor-handoff-workflow.md` |
| `node scripts/ci/diataxis_folder_audit.mjs` | **PASS** — no DIATAXIS folder hygiene defects detected |
| `node scripts/check-repo-structure.mjs` | **PASS** |
| `node .agents/checks/agent-governance-check.mjs` | **PASS** |
| ZIP-in-root check (`test ! -f ./drive-download*.zip`) | **PASS** — ZIP retained only under intake folder |

Notes:

- Header failure is **pre-existing** on the intake branch tip and is **outside** this audit allowlist. Flagged for ChatGPT; not fixed in #2360.
- No Drive draft was promoted; no new Diataxis authority file was created except this audit report.

## Repo tree findings that block blind promotion

These proposed draft target roots **do not exist** in the current repository:

| Proposed path / root | Repo reality |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/ops/programs/` | **Missing.** Existing ops clustering uses `docs/ops/projects/`, `docs/ops/implementation-plans/`, `docs/ops/pmo/`, `docs/ops/reports/`, `docs/ops/trackers/` |
| `docs/reference/website/content-collection/` | **Missing.** Existing content/reference authority lives under `docs/reference/content/` and `docs/reference/website/` (flat / Lou-Gehrig-named files) |
| `docs/governance/digital-asset-standard.md` | **Missing** |
| `docs/governance/website-accelerated-implementation-policy.md` | **Missing** |
| `docs/how-to/ops/cursor-parallel-worktree-standard.md` | Parent `docs/how-to/ops/` **exists**; file missing |
| `docs/reference/ci/pr-body-generator-contract.md` | **Missing** (CI refs exist under `docs/reference/ci/` for other surfaces) |

**ChatGPT decision (accepted):** do **not** create `docs/ops/programs/content-collection/`. Remap program docs to existing ops patterns (`docs/ops/reports/`, `docs/ops/implementation-plans/`, `docs/ops/pmo/`, `docs/how-to/ops/`). Do **not** create `docs/reference/website/content-collection/`; merge reference material into existing content and Lou Gehrig website docs.

## Existing overlapping authority (high-value inventory)

Content pipeline / model:

## Authority conflicts requiring ChatGPT/Bill direction

Do **not** silently resolve. Stop conditions from #2360 apply.

| ID | Conflict | Draft(s) | Existing authority | Recommended handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | “Pre-approved merge” language remains in body despite v2 note reframing it as procedural preclearance | Accelerated Implementation / PR Closeout Policy | `Agent.md`, PR lifecycle, merge authorization owned by Bill/ChatGPT | **Do not promote as-is.** Enrich to remove merge-authorization reinterpretation; keep procedural preclearance only |
| C2 | Codex still described as an active/possible implementation package consumer | Code Package Standard; Runbook v1; Accelerated Policy Codex section | `LGFC-AI-TEAM-OPERATING-MODEL.md` — Codex inactive/out | Strip/gate Codex language before promote |
| C3 | CC-001 content-asset contract vs existing candidate / inventory / metadata authority | CC-001 | `lgfc-content-candidate-model.md`, content inventory/schema, #2286 as-built pipeline docs | **Merge plan required** before any new parallel contract; forbid duplicate SOTs |
| C4 | CC-002 provenance/rights package vs existing Lou Gehrig provenance/rights models | CC-002 | `lou-gehrig-source-provenance-model.md`, `lou-gehrig-rights-privacy-publication-review.md`, how-to provenance review | Prefer **merge into existing** unless ChatGPT freezes a supersession |
| C5 | Validation Standard and VAL-001 both target the same promoted path | Validation Standard; VAL-001 | — | Consolidate into one ops validation doc; second becomes merge/do-not-promote |
| C6 | GitHub label/status addendum may invent program-local lifecycle vocabulary | Label/Status Mapping Addendum | PMO V4 + existing label/lifecycle docs | Promote only as **addendum that defers** to PMO V4; no parallel label authority |
| C7 | Proposed `docs/ops/programs/**` tree vs current ops folder authority | Diataxis Promotion Map; most program/package drafts | `DIATAXIS-FOLDER-AUTHORITY.md`, existing ops tree | ChatGPT picks tree strategy before any mass promotion |
| C8 | Accelerated policy / continuous-execution tone vs gate and parse-safe PR discipline | Accelerated Policy; Runbook v2 continuous-execution model | Shared/core PR preflight, issue-first, no mixed intent | Enrich carefully; must not weaken parser/gate law |
| C9 | PMO V4 header text still says V3 remains until #2100 PR merges, but PR #2282 is merged | (repo doc staleness affecting disposition) | `PMO-V4-OPERATING-MODEL.md`, merged PR #2282 | Note for separate docs hygiene; treat V4 as current for this audit |

## Disposition key

| Disposition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `promote` | Safe to create new target path after enrichment + ChatGPT path approval |
| `merge_into_existing` | Absorbed into named current repo doc(s); no parallel authority |
| `supersede` | Newer draft replaces older draft or thin planning artifact (not live product law without review) |
| `defer` | Real content, but later phase / later child issue |
| `do_not_promote` | Keep intake-only; outdated, provenance-only, or issue-body material |

Phase mapping uses program cadence from readiness/implementation-plan docs:

- **P0** docs audit/enrichment/promotion
- **P1** tooling/contracts/validation/PR-closeout support
- **P2** internal/admin/staging test surfaces
- **P3** visible Gallery/Library/Memorabilia/Club website work
- **P4** hardening/closeout registers

### Content contract / feature packages

| # | Source draft | Disposition | Overlapping repo docs | Proposed target | Conflicts | Enrichment needed | Phase |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 17 | CC-001 Content Asset Model | `merge_into_existing` first; conditional later promote of thin delta | candidate model; content inventory; metadata schema; #2286 as-built | prefer update existing `docs/reference/content/*` + website Lou-Gehrig refs; only create `content-asset-model.md` if ChatGPT freezes gap set | **C3**, C7 | explicit gap matrix vs #2286 / #2273 | P0→P1 |
| 18 | CC-002 Provenance / Rights Contract | `merge_into_existing` | provenance + rights models + how-tos | update existing Lou Gehrig provenance/rights docs | **C4** | avoid parallel contract | P0→P1 |
| 29 | GAL-001 Gallery Package | `defer` | fanclub design; club home design; content strategy | package under chosen ops cluster later | Phase 3 website | incomplete vs design authority; needs CC freeze | P3 (package docs may start late P1/P2) |
| 30 | LIB-001 Library Package | `defer` | library/content how-tos; design | same | Phase 3 | same | P3 |
| 31 | MEM-001 Memorabilia Package | `defer` | design / content strategy | same | Phase 3 | same | P3 |
| 32 | CLUB-001 Club Newspaper Design Package | `defer` / merge with design later | program-3 club home design; fanclub design; club how-to | prefer merge into design/ops club docs | Phase 3 | sparse draft (≈65 lines) | P3 |

### Manifest item not present as Drive draft

| # | Item | Disposition | Notes |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 38 | PMO Lessons Learned / Continuous Improvement Register | `do_not_promote` from this intake | Manifest says issue-created requirement in #2366; not a Drive draft in folder |

## Smallest safe first promotion set

Recommended **first documentation PR set** after ChatGPT disposition acceptance (still separate from this audit commit if preferred):

1. **Keep this audit report** as the #2360 closeout artifact (`docs/ops/reports/content-collection-docs-audit-dedup-2360.md`).
2. **Promote only after path decision C7:**
   - #2286 Inheritance Map
   - #1738 Successor Program Decision
   - Runbook v2 (with C2/C8 scrub)
3. **Explicitly exclude from first promotion PR:**
   - Accelerated Policy (C1)
   - GAL/LIB/MEM/CLUB packages (Phase 3)
   - CI-001/CI-002 and CI orchestration impl plans beyond Stage 0 inventory framing (Phase 1)
   - CC-001/CC-002 as new parallel contracts (C3/C4) until merge matrix approved
   - Issue-body packs as docs files
   - ZIP / intake README/manifest

Optional fourth item if ChatGPT wants governance early: **Digital Asset Standard** only after Owns/Does-Not-Own review against locked design docs.

## Recommended next child-issue packaging (#2359)

Align to parent child list, using this audit:

1. #2360 — audit/dedup (**this deliverable**)
2. Foundation enrichment: Runbook v2, inheritance/successor decisions, Digital Asset + Code Package + Validation standards (after conflict scrub)
3. Feature package enrichment: CC-001/CC-002 merge matrices, then GAL/LIB/MEM/CLUB package docs
4. Control/ops enrichment: Stage 0 CI gap analysis, review throttle, label addendum under PMO
5. Support docs: deferred/risk/closeout registers, prompt pack → template merge
6. Promotion PR + validation closeout (only after issue-level disposition approval)

## ChatGPT disposition decisions (accepted 2026-07-08)

ChatGPT reviewed the Phase 0 handoff on #2360 with status `disposition-approved-with-constraints`. Cursor accepts these decisions and records them here as authoritative for downstream #2359 child work.

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| C7 tree strategy | **Do not** create `docs/ops/programs/`. Reuse `docs/ops/reports/`, `docs/ops/implementation-plans/`, `docs/ops/pmo/`, `docs/how-to/ops/`, and existing `docs/reference/projects/` / content / website reference folders. |
| C3/C4 reference strategy | **Do not** create `docs/reference/website/content-collection/` at this time. Merge model/provenance/rights/metadata into existing `docs/reference/content/*` and Lou Gehrig website reference docs. CC-001/CC-002 become gap matrices / deltas only — not parallel SOTs. |
| Accelerated Policy (C1/C8) | Reject promote-as-is; defer/rewrite only. |
| First promotion set (after scrub) | Audit report; #2286 Inheritance Map; #1738 Successor Decision; Runbook v2 — with exclusions listed below. |
| Digital Asset Standard | Not in first PR unless Owns/Does-Not-Own review against locked design/governance is clean. |
| Downstream work | Block #2361 / #2363 / #2364 enrichment until this #2360 audit PR is reviewed/merged. |

**Approved first promotion set constraints (Runbook v2 scrub required):**

- No GAL/LIB/MEM/CLUB packages
- No CI-001 / CI-002 tooling packages
- No CC-001 / CC-002 as new parallel contracts
- No issue-body packs as standalone docs
- Scrub Codex language, legacy Atlas terminology, and merge/authorization drift from Runbook v2

**Remapped target paths (per ChatGPT C7):**

| Draft (when promoted later) | Approved target pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Runbook v2, inheritance map, successor decision, lane map, package index, registers | `docs/ops/reports/` or `docs/ops/implementation-plans/` under content-collection naming |
| CI Stage 0 gap analysis | `docs/ops/implementation-plans/ci-stage-0-current-state-gap-analysis.md` |
| Cursor parallel worktree standard | `docs/how-to/ops/cursor-parallel-worktree-standard.md` |
| CC-001 / CC-002 deltas | merge into `docs/reference/content/*` + existing Lou Gehrig website refs |
| Feature packages (GAL/LIB/MEM/CLUB) | deferred; enrich under later child issues when Phase allows |

## Documentation source classification

`DIATAXIS_ROUTED` — ops report audit artifact under `docs/ops/reports/`; Drive intake remains non-Diataxis source material.
