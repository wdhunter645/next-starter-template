# Agent assignment Git/PR field hardening — #2564

## Objective

Make every future Cursor implementation assignment state execution environment and Git/PR authority as mandatory fields so local-only completion cannot be confused with authorized branch/PR delivery.

## Predecessor

#2563 / PR #2617 integrated into `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` at `eb729385`.

## Changed paths (allowlist only)

| Path | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/templates/agent-assignment-template.md` | Added required-fields rows and mandatory template section **2A. Git / Branch / PR Authority**; updated checkpoint and prohibited omissions; distinguished local-only vs branch/PR delivery |
| `docs/ops/ai/CURSOR-RULES.md` | Minimal cross-reference to section 2A; stop if Git/PR fields missing |
| `docs/reference/pmo/lgfc-cursor-execution-contract.md` | Minimal Default Permissions note that section 2A fields are mandatory authorization |
| `docs/ops/reports/agent-assignment-git-pr-fields-1719.md` | This report |

## Mandatory fields added

- Runtime / execution environment (`local` / `cloud` / `either`) — already present; now labeled as Cursor Local vs Cursor Cloud explicitly
- Working branch name
- Base / target branch
- Branch creation authorized (`YES` / `NO`)
- Commit authorized (`YES` / `NO`)
- Push authorized (`YES` / `NO`)
- Open PR authorized (`YES` / `NO`)
- Required PR target
- PR initial state (`draft` / `ready-for-review` / `not-applicable`)
- Post-PR continuation (`stop-after-pr-open` / `continue-remediation-same-issue` / `not-applicable`)
- Self-approval / self-merge / promotion to `main` — default `NO` unless separately authorized

## Local-only vs branch/PR delivery

- **Local-only:** create, commit, push, and open-PR are all `NO`.
- **Branch/PR delivery:** any of those are `YES`; then working branch, base/target, and PR target (when Open PR is `YES`) must be exact names — not implied prose.

## Consistency

| Document | Alignment |
| --- | --- |
| Assignment template | Owns the mandatory field definitions and copy/paste block |
| `CURSOR-RULES.md` | Points Cursor at section 2A; forbids treating narrative as Git/PR authority |
| Cursor execution contract | Restates that create/commit/push/PR require section 2A fields |

## Acceptance mapping

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Future assignments must make local/cloud execution explicit | PASS — Runtime / execution environment required |
| Branch, base, create, commit, push, PR authority are mandatory fields | PASS — section 2A + required-fields table |
| PR target and post-PR continuation explicit | PASS |
| Template distinguishes local-only from branch/PR delivery | PASS |
| Cursor rules and execution contract reference fields consistently | PASS |
| Concise report recorded | PASS (this file) |

## Boundaries honored

- No self-approval / self-merge
- No retarget to `main`
- No allowlist expansion
- No runtime product code or workflow changes
