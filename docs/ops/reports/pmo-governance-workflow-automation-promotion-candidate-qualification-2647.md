# Program #1719 Promotion Candidate Qualification (#2647)

## Purpose

Record the exact Promotion Candidate prepared by synchronizing accepted Program
#1719 component history with current `main`, including conflict dispositions,
reserved #1727 cleanup corrections, validation evidence, rollback status, and
the Atlas Go/No-Go recommendation.

## Scope

- Synchronization of `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` accepted tip
  into working branch `cursor/1719-promotion-candidate-sync` by merging current
  `main` without rewriting component history.
- Conflict resolution for constitutional/domain-policy authority files.
- Reserved #1727 cleanup edits and this qualification report.
- One PR targeting only the component branch.

Out of scope: Production promotion PR to `main`, self-approval, self-merge,
workflow redesign, website changes, secrets, credentials, branch-protection
changes, and external mutations.

## Current known truth

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source issue | #2647 |
| Parent program | #1719 |
| Accepted component starting SHA | `5a005e9e1c3ccff04192709a833d100e35b5874a` |
| Current `main` SHA consumed | `8a3f56e65b90b36729d96dce2005ea21cc27e08f` |
| Working branch | `cursor/1719-promotion-candidate-sync` |
| PR base | `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` |
| Merge method | `git merge origin/main` (no rebase / no history rewrite) |
| Ahead/behind at merge start | component 18 ahead / 53 behind `main` |

Candidate head SHA is the final push tip of this working branch after the merge
commit and the reserved cleanup/qualification commit(s). Record the exact SHA in
the PR body and `CHATGPT HANDOFF` at open time.

## Conflict inventory and dispositions

Eight conflict files. Disposition for each: **preserve current `main`
constitutional and domain-policy authority** (`git checkout --theirs` during the
merge where HEAD was the component branch).

| File | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `.agents/skills/lgfc-pr-governance/SKILL.md` | main wins |
| `docs/governance/DELIVERY-AND-RELEASE.md` | main wins |
| `docs/governance/PR_LIFECYCLE_STATE_MACHINE.md` | main wins |
| `docs/governance/PR_PROCESS.md` | main wins |
| `docs/ops/ai/chatgpt-cursor-handoff-workflow.md` | main wins |
| `docs/ops/pmo/PMO-JULY-2026-OPERATING-MODEL.md` | main wins |
| `docs/ops/pmo/github-issue-closeout-protocol.md` | main wins |
| `docs/ops/pmo/queue-watch-and-dispatch-protocol.md` | main wins |

Rationale: current `main` carries the canonical four-lane / four-profile model
from #2640/#2642 and subsequent communication governance. Unique #1719
construction deliverables that did not conflict remain on the component history
and continue through the merge.

## Reserved #1727 cleanup corrections

1. `docs/ops/pmo/pmo-governance-workflow-automation-completion-readiness.md` —
   related-issue / current-state metadata updated for #2647 and #2640.
2. `docs/ops/reports/pmo-governance-workflow-automation-closeout-1727.md` —
   added concise `Scope` and `Current known truth` sections.

## Validation

Recorded at PR open. Minimum commands:

- conflict inventory posted on #2647 before resolution
- `git diff --check`
- documentation / governance / delivery-profile / PR-governance checks applicable
  to the synchronized result
- relevant Vitest/Node tests for touched governance or CI contracts when required
  by changed paths
- no tracked ZIP / secret scan checks

Exact command/result lines appear in the PR `## Verification` section.

## Rollback package

Rollback remains: close or reject the child PR without merging to the component
branch; if already integrated to the component branch, revert the merge commit on
`component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation`. No Production rollback is required
because this task never merges to `main`.

## Unresolved gaps

- Atlas Promotion Candidate Go/No-Go not yet recorded.
- Separate Production promotion Issue/PR to `main` is still required after Go.
- Deferred workflow/CI candidates C-01–C-06 from #1727 remain out of scope.

## Qualification recommendation

**PROMOTION CANDIDATE READY** for Atlas Go/No-Go review of the synchronized
component candidate, contingent on CI gates on the child PR and Atlas review of
this packet. This is not Production Go and does not authorize merge to `main`.
