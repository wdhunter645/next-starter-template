# Watcher action and mutation authority contract — #2566

## Objective

Define a precise watcher contract that separates detection-only watches from watches authorized to perform bounded repository actions, so watchers do not repeatedly report actionable work while being unable to advance it.

## Predecessor

#2565 / PR #2628 integrated into `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` at `515bcd37ed51d71d31e04ff0b629c55eda7fbaad`.

## Profiles

| Profile | Mutation | Required authority text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Advisory watcher** | Detect and notify only | Explicit `Watcher profile: advisory` and `Mutation classes authorized: none` (optional `notice-comment-only`) |
| **Dispatcher watcher** | Bounded mutations listed in the queue-watch protocol | Explicit `Watcher profile: dispatcher` plus a named mutation-class list in the scheduled prompt or controlling repository issue |

Generic words such as “monitor,” “review,” “watch,” or “notify” are not mutation authority.

## Bounded dispatcher mutations

When explicitly authorized, a dispatcher watcher may:

1. Comment on issues/PRs.
2. Consume `CHATGPT HANDOFF` with one `CHATGPT RESPONSE` or `CHATGPT CLOSEOUT`.
3. Post one separate `LOCAL CURSOR RESUME` referencing that response/closeout.
4. Assign source issue / active PR to `wdhunter645`.
5. Restore approved Cursor wake labels `agent:cursor` + `handoff:ready`.
6. Clear stale completed-predecessor blockers.
7. Create/update bounded Ops remediation issues.
8. Route the next eligible task in an already approved lane.

## Protected / owner-only (denied without separate authority)

- Merge
- Source / parent / program / umbrella issue closure
- Branch or tag deletion
- CI-gate or required-check changes
- Production configuration or secrets mutation
- Cursor Cloud invocation (`@cursor`) for local work
- Removing active wake labels from work still assigned to Cursor
- Unapproved lane start or unauthorized parallel execution

Aligned with `#1724` default-deny issue-mutation matrix:
`docs/ops/reports/issue-mutation-closeout-permission-1724.md`.

## Signal consumption

| Signal | Advisory | Dispatcher (authorized) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent:ChatGPT` idle | Report idle review markers | Do not invent review completion |
| `CHATGPT HANDOFF` awaiting reply | Report age + requested action | One response/closeout + one resume when Cursor must continue |
| Stale predecessor blocker | Report blocker + successor | Clear stale blocker; activate/resume successor under lane rules |
| Missing Cursor wake pair | Report missing labels | Restore `agent:cursor` + `handoff:ready` |
| Silent stall | Report evidence gap | Correct transaction or remediate; never claim active without pickup evidence |

## Reusable prompt patterns

Canonical detect-only and bounded-dispatch prompt blocks live in
`docs/ops/pmo/queue-watch-and-dispatch-protocol.md` under **Reusable watcher prompt patterns**.

## Changed paths (allowlist)

| Path | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/ops/pmo/queue-watch-and-dispatch-protocol.md` | Watcher profiles, bounded mutations, protected actions, signal consumption, prompt patterns; mutation-authority summary |
| `docs/ops/ai/chatgpt-cursor-handoff-workflow.md` | Minimal dispatcher-task and stall-escalation alignment |
| `docs/ops/pmo/github-issue-closeout-protocol.md` | Minimal cross-reference: closeout remains protected vs advisory watches |
| `docs/ops/reports/watcher-action-mutation-contract-1719.md` | This report |

## Scenario review

| Scenario | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory detection of actionable stall | Report + recommended owner; no label/assign/response/resume mutation |
| Stale predecessor blocker after verified closeout | Dispatcher clears blocker and routes successor when authorized |
| Missing Cursor wake labels on eligible task | Dispatcher restores wake pair when authorized |
| Remediation creation for launch-halting defect | Dispatcher creates/updates bounded Ops issue when authorized |
| Protected-action request (merge/close/delete/CI/prod) | Refuse; require separate owner authority |

## Mutation-permission comparison to #1724

| #1724 rule | Watcher contract alignment |
| --- | --- |
| Cursor default deny for close/reopen/relabel/state | Watchers default deny; dispatcher may only use listed classes when explicit |
| Merge is not closeout | Source/program close remains protected |
| Docs recommend ≠ permission to mutate | Advisory findings recommend; do not mutate |
| Atlas/Bill/controller own authorized closeout | Unchanged |

## Five-follow-up integration verification (Program #1719 promotion gate)

Originating review intake: #2528. Parent program: #1719.

| Follow-up | Issue | PR | Merge SHA on `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` | Issue state | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/5 | #2562 | #2602 | `cf9177c4decb35c9afaa6b543f2418bc5a54523e` | CLOSED | Integrated |
| 2/5 | #2563 | #2617 | `eb729385de1c523f91a81db91ca55fce3cb36764` | CLOSED | Integrated |
| 3/5 | #2564 | #2625 | `6202cc798f82887aa4a42040d18b5a34c4f42389` | CLOSED | Integrated |
| 4/5 | #2565 | #2628 | `515bcd37ed51d71d31e04ff0b629c55eda7fbaad` | CLOSED | Integrated |
| 5/5 | #2566 | *(this PR)* | *(pending component integration)* | OPEN until verified integration + closeout | **Promotion blocker until integrated** |

### Promotion-readiness restoration rule

Program #1719 promotion-readiness review may resume only after:

1. This Follow-up 5/5 PR is independently merged into `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation`.
2. #2566 receives verified integration evidence and canonical `CHATGPT CLOSEOUT`.
3. ChatGPT/Bill confirm all five rows above show Integrated with merge SHAs on the component branch.

Until those conditions hold, treat Program #1719 promotion readiness as **blocked** by Follow-up 5/5. Terminal promotion-readiness review remains a separate ChatGPT/Bill-controlled step after verified integration.

## Acceptance mapping

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Advisory and mutation-authorized profiles explicitly separate | PASS — profile table + sections |
| Exact bounded dispatcher mutations listed | PASS — eight classes |
| Protected/owner-only actions remain prohibited | PASS — protected list |
| Scheduled prompts must carry explicit mutation authority | PASS — authority text + prompt patterns |
| Consumes `agent:ChatGPT`, `CHATGPT HANDOFF`, stale blockers, missing wake labels | PASS — signal table |
| Reusable detect-only and bounded-dispatch prompt patterns | PASS — queue-watch patterns + this report |
| Final verification of all five follow-ups before promotion readiness | PASS for 1–4; 5/5 pending this PR’s component integration |

## Boundaries honored

- No ChatGPT product-automation mutation
- No self-approve / self-merge / retarget to `main`
- No unrelated issue mutation
- Allowlist only
