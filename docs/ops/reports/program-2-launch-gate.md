# Program 2 Launch Gate

## Purpose

Record Program 1 Task 008 launch-gate evidence as of **2026-06-06** under source issue
`#1385`. This document confirms Tasks 001–007 deliverables on `main`, adopts Task 006
P0 findings into Program 2 remediation (none waived), lists authorized Program 2 child
projects, and captures **Bill's** approval before Program 2 implementation plans move to
`issues-created`.

## Boundary Statement

This task is **governance documentation only**.

- No workflow YAML, application code, or branch protection changes
- No Program 2 implementation issues are created by this document
- **Bill** remains final Program 2 launch authority; sign-off below is required before
  activation is effective

## Authority and Corrections Register

| Event | Correction |
|---|---|
| PR `#1382` post-merge closeout | Closed `#1346` after worklist-only hygiene. **Did not** satisfy Task 008. |
| Issue `#1385` | Supersedes premature `#1346` closeout; encodes adopted (not waived) P0 sequencing. |
| PR `#1381` post-merge validation | Failed on unchecked acceptance criteria; remediated via dedicated closeout PR. |

PR `#1382` is **not** Task 008 completion. Task 008 deliverable is this document plus
supporting PMO registry updates.

## Task 001–007 Deliverable Checklist

| Task | Issue | Merge PR | Primary deliverable on `main` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 PMO registry | `#1339` | (Task 001 era) | [`docs/ops/pmo/program-registry.md`](/docs/ops/pmo/program-registry.md), [`critical-path.md`](/docs/ops/pmo/critical-path.md), [`parallel-agent-rules.md`](/docs/ops/pmo/parallel-agent-rules.md) | Complete |

Supporting hygiene: PR `#1382` synced [`docs/ops/pmo/program-portfolio-worklist.md`](/docs/ops/pmo/program-portfolio-worklist.md) (not a Task 008 substitute).

## P0 Finding Disposition (Task 006)

**No P0 findings are waived.** H-001, H-002, and H-003 are **adopted** into Program 2
remediation and must complete in the sequencing order below before dependent Program 2
implementation relies on the affected surfaces.

| ID | Finding | Disposition | Program 2 placement |
|---|---|---|---|
| H-001 | Post-merge remediation backlog and closeout-chain drift (34+ open `post-merge-failure` issues) | **Adopted** | Early CI/automation stabilization workstream under `#1058` (**A-009**, **A-013**) |
| H-002 | OPS assess soft-fail masks runtime failures | **Adopted** | Early OPS hardening task under `#1058` (**A-001**) |
| H-003 | Open CI redesign orphan issues `#1011`, `#1009`, `#1199` | **Adopted** | Immediate/early CI closeout hygiene under `#1058` (**A-010**) |

Evidence: [`docs/ops/reports/program-1-operational-health-review.md`](/docs/ops/reports/program-1-operational-health-review.md)  
Backlog routing: [`docs/ops/reports/program-1-automation-backlog.md`](/docs/ops/reports/program-1-automation-backlog.md)

## Adopted P0 Remediation Sequencing

Adopted P0 remediation **precedes** dependent Program 2 implementation that assumes
stable post-merge closeout, accurate CI program state, or reliable OPS health signals.

```text
H-003 (immediate/early) → H-001 (early CI/automation) → H-002 (early OPS hardening)
         ↓                           ↓                            ↓
   CI orphan closeout          closeout-chain stability        OPS assess hardening
   under #1058 / A-010         under #1058 / A-009, A-013      under #1058 / A-001
```

| Sequence | Finding | Required early work | Blocks until addressed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Immediate/early** | H-003 | Atlas/program-owner closeout batch for `#1011`, `#1009`, `#1199` under `#1058` CI maintenance (**A-010**) | Program 2 CI maintenance tasks that treat redesign closeout as complete |
| **2 — Early** | H-001 | Post-merge remediation and closeout-chain stabilization (**A-009**); queue-label reconciliation (**A-013**) | Program 2 work that depends on post-merge closeout metadata stability |
| **3 — Early** | H-002 | OPS assess hardening — fail-closed or explicit reporting contract (**A-001**) | Program 2 OPS tasks that treat scheduled assessment as authoritative health signal |

Program 2 phase-2 plan tasks (`#1273`–`#1276`) and other child-project implementation
**may be planned** after launch-gate approval but **must not** proceed past early
sequencing gates above without owner acknowledgment of residual risk.

## Authorized Program 2 Child Projects

Activation is **conditional on Bill's sign-off** below. After sign-off, these child
projects may proceed to issue-per-task factory under their umbrella plans:

| Child project | Umbrella / plan | Preconditions | First authorized work (after P0 sequencing) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CI maintenance | `#1058`, [`issue-1075-ci-phase2-closeout-rollout.md`](/docs/ops/implementation-plans/issue-1075-ci-phase2-closeout-rollout.md) Tasks 002–005 | Launch gate signed; **H-003 then H-001** adopted remediation underway or complete | Branch protection (`#1273`), drift dedup (`#1274`), legacy retirement (`#1275`), inventory rewrite (`#1276`) |
| Website completion | `#1255` | Launch gate signed; Task 003 reconciliation; H-006 disposition | Phase 0 tracker/GitHub reconciliation (**A-011**); T43+ serial queue |
| OPS hardening | `#1058` (OPS track) | Launch gate signed; **H-002** adopted remediation underway or complete | OPS assess hardening (**A-001**), assess-nightly retirement (**A-002**), CF retry model (**A-003**) |
| Website QA / launch readiness | `#1259` / `#1112` | Launch gate signed; H-011; owner approval for scheduled e2e | Launch-readiness CI wiring (**A-004**) if program owner approves |
| Automation and agent orchestration | Program 2 (from Task 007) | Launch gate signed; H-001 stabilization progress | PMO worklist sync (**A-012**), queue-label automation (**A-013**) |

## Program 3 Holding (unchanged)

Program 3 candidates (**A-014** through **A-018**, `#1132`) remain deferred until
explicit program-owner promotion. Launch gate does not authorize Program 3 execution.

## Program 2 Activation Statement

After **Bill** records sign-off below:

- Program 2 implementation plans **may** move to `issues-created` status.
- Orchestrator issues `#1273`–`#1276` **may** be queue-promoted under `#1058` per
  phase-2 plan order, subject to adopted P0 sequencing above.
- Program 1 umbrella `#1335` **may** be closed with pointer to this document after
  Task 008 source issue closes complete and sign-off is recorded.

Until sign-off is recorded, Program 2 remains **blocked** per registry rules.

Program 2 implementation plans **must not** move to `issues-created` until this gate
is approved by **Bill**.

## Program 1 Umbrella `#1335` Closeout Rule

**May `#1335` be closed after Task 008 completion?** **Yes**, after both conditions:

1. This launch-gate PR merges and `#1385` closes complete with evidence.
2. **Bill** records sign-off below with approver name and ISO date.

Do **not** close `#1335` in the Task 008 implementation PR; close only after merge and
Bill sign-off.

## Sign-Off Record (Bill — Final Launch Authority)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Gate document | `docs/ops/reports/program-2-launch-gate.md` |
| Source issue | `#1385` |
| Assessment date | 2026-06-06 |
| Program owner approver | Bill Hunter |
| Sign-off date | 2026-06-06 |
| Sign-off method | Repo document update approved by Bill Hunter |

**Checklist attestation (Cursor implementation):** Tasks 001–007 deliverables verified
on `main`; no P0 findings waived; H-001–H-003 adopted with sequencing documented;
authorized child projects listed; no workflow or runtime changes introduced by this task.

**Effective authorization:** Program 2 activation is effective as of the Bill Hunter
sign-off recorded above.
