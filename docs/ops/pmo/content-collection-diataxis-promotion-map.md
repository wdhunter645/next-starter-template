# Content Collection Diataxis Promotion Map

## Purpose

Assign every Drive planning document under `_incoming/drive-drafts/content-collection/` to an approved repository path before promotion.

## Scope

Owns C7-remapped target paths, control/package mapping tables, promotion status tokens, and conflict stop rules for intake drafts.

Does not own Diataxis authority of intake `.docx` files, feature implementation, or merge authorization.

## Current known truth

- Intake `.docx` files on `ChatGPT/drive-draft-intake-2367` are non-authoritative.
- Dedup/merge authority is `docs/ops/reports/content-collection-docs-audit-dedup-2360.md` only.
- Rejected roots: `docs/ops/programs/`, `docs/reference/website/content-collection/`.
- Phase 0 child chain #2360–#2364 merged; terminal closeout #2365 in progress.
- Closeout artifact: `docs/ops/reports/content-collection-phase0-promotion-closeout-2365.md`.

## Intended final state

Every intake draft has an approved target path or explicit `do_not_promote` / `deferred` disposition with trackable `promotion_status` tokens.

## Promotion rule

Intake `.docx` files are planning support only. Authority requires Markdown at the mapped path, a reviewed PR with one source issue, and issue linkage.

Dedup/merge authority: `docs/ops/reports/content-collection-docs-audit-dedup-2360.md` only — no parallel dedup doc.

## Deferred / do not promote

| --- | --- |
| Accelerated Policy | do_not_promote until rewrite (C1/C8) |
| Digital Asset Standard | deferred pending Owns review |
| Issue-body packs | GitHub-only |
| Deferred/risk registers | Promoted under #2364 — see Support documents |
| Runbook v2, inheritance map, successor decision | deferred — future child issues per #2360 first-set |

## Promotion status values

`planned` | `draft` | `promoted_to_repo` | `pr_open` | `merged_pending_validation` | `validated` | `complete` | `deferred` | `do_not_promote`

## Conflicts — stop without ChatGPT/Bill disposition

C1 pre-approved merge; C2 Codex active; C3/C4 parallel contracts; C5 dual validation authority; C6 parallel labels; C8 gate weakening.

## Validation

```bash
bash scripts/ci/docs_check_headers.sh
node scripts/ci/diataxis_folder_audit.mjs
node .agents/checks/agent-governance-check.mjs
```

## Procedure

1. Read #2360 disposition before adding rows.
2. Enrich with `git ls-files` verification.
3. Open one-issue docs PR with exact allowlist.
4. Update `promotion_status` column after merge.
