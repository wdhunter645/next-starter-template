# PMO Dashboard Tracking Audit — Issue #2299

## Historical status

**Historical evidence only — not live operational authority.**

This audit records the #2299 reconciliation snapshot. Portfolio membership, lifecycle, and priority in this file are frozen evidence from that repair window. Current PMO tracking, lifecycle, priority, stage, task relationships, and closeout state are owned exclusively by live GitHub Issues and the PMO July 2026 issue contract. Do not use this document or frozen `expectedLifecycle` / `expectedPriority` inventory fields to override current Issue metadata.

Canonical current docs:

- `/docs/ops/pmo/PMO-JULY-2026-OPERATING-MODEL.md`
- `/docs/ops/pmo/PMO-JULY-2026-DASHBOARD-SPECIFICATION.md`
- `/docs/how-to/pmo/pmo-dashboard.md`
- `/docs/reference/pmo/pmo-dashboard-single-authority-implementation-plan.md`

## Purpose

Document PMO dashboard inventory reconciliation performed for issue #2299 so every tracked PMO program, project, idea, strategy, planning item, active item, pipeline item, and completed item is accounted for as active, pipeline, completed, or explicitly excluded with rationale.

## Generator change

Expanded dashboard title inclusion from `PROGRAM:` / `PROJECT:` only to also include:

- `PROGRAM CANDIDATE:`
- `STRATEGY:`
- `STRATEGY REVIEW:`

Machine-readable inventory used at the time of this audit: `scripts/pmo-dashboard/pmo-tracked-inventory.json`. At audit time that file also carried frozen `expectedLifecycle` / `expectedPriority` guardrails. Project #2610 retires those fields as live authority; residual inventory use is limited to explicit non-state exclusions and offline fixtures.

## Label-driven tracking update (#2313)

Issue #2313 supersedes title-prefix inclusion as the dashboard tracking gate:

- `PMO` / `pmo` label = PMO-tracked and eligible for dashboard rows.
- No PMO label = excluded even when a recognized title prefix is present.
- Title prefixes still identify row type for display.
- Child projects use `PROJECT: <parentProgramIssue>:<sequence> | <title>` and nest under active parent programs.

## Completed programs

| Issue | Name | Notes |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #1685 | Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout | `status:complete` label; GitHub issue still OPEN |
| #2100 | PMO V4 Repository Authority Promotion | Closed project |
| #2039 | Website Public Launch / Relaunch Readiness | Closed program |

## Explicitly excluded issues

| Issue | Rationale |
| ---: | --- |
| #2101 | `DESIGN:` title prefix outside dashboard taxonomy; closed design/pre-build record. CI implementation evidence exists elsewhere. |
| #1847 | `OPS` title prefix; closed operations program, not PMO dashboard inventory row. |
| #2288 | `TASK:` child issue under #2286; not a standalone PMO dashboard row per #2299 scope boundary. |
| #1075 | Historical CI orchestration project; outside #2299 tracked inventory. |
| #1039 | Historical DIATAXIS governance project; outside tracked inventory. |
| #1076 | Historical DIATAXIS migration project; outside tracked inventory. |
| #1054 | Historical repository governance project; outside tracked inventory. |
| #1335 | Historical Phase 1 wrap-up program; PMO July 2026 archive evidence. |

## Atlas decisions (resolved)

1. **#1685** — Keep `Dashboard Lifecycle: completed`. Do not close GitHub issue in this PR.
2. **#1738** — Pipeline Priority #20, `Paused (launch-gated)`.
3. **#2273** — Pipeline, `Planning complete (successor #2286 active)`. Do not close or archive in this PR.
4. **#2286** — Active Priority #1 (core acceptance condition).
5. **Legacy rows (#1075, #1039, #1076, #1054, #1335)** — Explicitly excluded from dashboard output via tracked inventory.

## Priority rule applied

Priority reflects LGFC website/repository need per PMO July 2026, not implementation readiness. Pipeline items may rank highly while still launch-gated.

## Validation (historical procedure)

After issue metadata updates and dashboard regeneration for #2299:

```bash
node scripts/pmo-dashboard/build-dashboard.mjs
node scripts/pmo-dashboard/validate-dashboard.mjs site/pmo-dashboard
```

At that time, validation also compared generated rows to frozen inventory `expectedLifecycle` / `expectedPriority` values. That comparison is a documented authority defect under project #2610 and must not be treated as correct current operator guidance. Current validation authority is the live Issue-derived contract in the dashboard specification; residual inventory checks after runtime repair may only enforce explicit exclusions and offline fixtures.
