# Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout Readiness

> Program #1685 structural baseline is **ready for Bill/Atlas launch review** after CI Program #1963 closeout. Cursor may not execute Program #2039 work from this package.

## Purpose

This document converts PMO Backlog Priority #1 into a PMO v3 next-program readiness package.

Priority #1 is the **Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout** group. The group contains the unfinished projects required to turn the existing website foundation into a complete member-facing Fan Club product buildout suitable for Cursor implementation after launch authorization.

## Scope

This readiness package covers these Priority #1 projects:

1. Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout
2. Fan Club page design
3. Website backend services
4. Content management strategy
5. Content collection strategy
6. Website design review / as-built versus LGFC vision

This document owns the PMO readiness decision, project boundaries, source-of-truth map, missing-decision register, implementation-readiness classification, and Cursor pre-launch requirements.

This document does not launch implementation, create child issues, authorize Cursor execution, change runtime behavior, update workflow YAML, define fundraiser implementation, or supersede canonical production design authority.

## Current known truth

- PMO Backlog Priority #1 is a project-draft group, not an executable queue by itself.
- The PMO Backlog identifies Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout as the highest-priority future program candidate.
- Canonical production design authority exists in `docs/reference/design/LGFC-Production-Design-and-Standards.md`.
- Fan Club destination-page design authority exists in `docs/reference/design/fanclub-subpages.md`.
- A legacy Fan Club home design draft exists at `docs/ops/pmo/program-3-club-home-page-design.md`; this file is planning evidence, not PMO v3 launch authority.
- Content strategy and editorial inventory planning exists in `docs/ops/implementation-plans/website-content-strategy-editorial-inventory.md` and supporting Diataxis website content documents.
- Website operations/admin work is documented as completed in `docs/ops/implementation-plans/website-operations-admin.md`; Priority #1 backend work must reconcile against that existing work instead of rebuilding it.
- PMO v3 requires explicit Atlas/Bill launch authorization before Cursor implementation.

## Intended final state

After this readiness package is approved, Priority #1 should be usable as the next program-of-work planning package for Cursor assignment.

The intended final state before implementation launch is:

- one PMO v3 program candidate with a clear launch-state control statement;
- child-project boundaries for Fan Club page design, backend services, content management, content collection, and design/as-built review;
- an implementation plan that defines task order, file areas, validation, and closeout expectations;
- explicit decisions for duplicate/merged content strategy items;
- no requirement for Cursor to infer product design from chat history, legacy PMO v2 program names, or stale trackers.

## Child-project readiness inventory

| Priority item | project name | Current state | Design authority | Implementation plan state | Readiness decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout | PMO v3 program candidate | This readiness doc plus production design authority | `website-completion-fan-club-product-buildout.md` | Ready for Bill/Atlas launch review |
| 1a | Fan Club page design | Legacy planning draft with strong design content | `program-3-club-home-page-design.md`, `fanclub-subpages.md`, production design standards | Covered by Tasks 001, 003, 007, 009 | Ready for implementation planning after launch |
| 1b | Website backend services | Partially implemented across prior content/admin work | production design data model, content inventory model, admin operations plan | Covered by Tasks 001, 002, 004, 005, 006 | Ready for gap-first implementation planning after launch |
| 1c | Content management strategy | Partially documented and partially implemented | content strategy / content inventory / editorial placement docs | Covered by Tasks 001, 004, 005, 006 | Ready for reconciliation-first implementation planning after launch |
| 1d | Content collection strategy | Previously duplicate/version candidate | This package folds it into content management as the upstream intake and source/credit pipeline | Covered by Tasks 004 and 005 | Resolved: child of content management, not standalone next-program peer |
| 1e | Website design review / as-built versus LGFC vision | Needed as first implementation guardrail | production design standards, fanclub subpage specs | Covered by Task 001 and final Task 009 | Ready as first Cursor task after launch |

## Boundary decisions

### Content collection strategy relationship

Content collection strategy is not a separate next-program peer. It is part of the content management and editorial pipeline within the Website Completion / Fan Club Product Buildout program.

Decision:

- Treat content collection as the upstream intake layer for content management.
- Keep discovery, source/credit, review, and publication handoff inside this Priority #1 program.
- Do not implement external monitoring, automated ingestion, or AI research automation in this program unless a later task explicitly scopes it.

### Fundraiser boundary

Fundraiser / Charity Campaign Operations Buildout remains a separate future program candidate.

Priority #1 may include only passive design accommodation for future campaign modules, such as fail-closed placeholders or approved-content slots, when they do not implement fundraiser operations, Givebutter integration, leaderboard logic, winner rules, or donor recognition automation.

### Backend services boundary

Priority #1 backend services are gap-first, not greenfield.

Cursor must reconcile current `functions/api/**`, D1 tables, B2/media mappings, admin surfaces, and tests before adding runtime deltas. Existing work from content/admin programs must be reused when it satisfies the product requirement.

## Source-of-truth map

| Area | Primary source | Use in next program |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PMO operating model | `docs/ops/pmo/PMO-V3-OPERATING-MODEL.md` | Launch gate, program issue model, backlog promotion rule |
| PMO backlog | `docs/ops/pmo/pmo-backlog.md` | Priority #1 inventory source |
| Program registry | `docs/ops/pmo/program-registry.md` | Program numbering, launch-state language, Cursor boundary |
| Production design | `docs/reference/design/LGFC-Production-Design-and-Standards.md` | Route, auth, navigation, footer, data-model invariants |
| Fan Club subpages | `docs/reference/design/fanclub-subpages.md` | Existing `/fanclub/photo`, `/fanclub/library`, `/fanclub/memorabilia`, `/fanclub/myprofile` contracts |
| Club Home planning draft | `docs/ops/pmo/program-3-club-home-page-design.md` | Planning evidence for authenticated Fan Club page design; converted through this package |
| Website content strategy | `docs/ops/implementation-plans/website-content-strategy-editorial-inventory.md` | Content inventory and editorial pipeline source |
| Website admin/ops | `docs/ops/implementation-plans/website-operations-admin.md` | Existing backend/admin surfaces to reconcile before building |
| QA/validation plan | `docs/ops/implementation-plans/website-qa-production-validation.md` | Launch validation context and no-regression checks |

## Required implementation decisions now resolved

| Decision | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Is Priority #1 the next program group? | Yes, pending Bill/Atlas launch after planning PR approval. |
| Is Fan Club page design part of the program? | Yes. It is a core child project. |
| Is content collection standalone? | No. It is the upstream intake/source-credit layer inside content management strategy. |
| Should existing admin/content work be rebuilt? | No. Cursor must reconcile first and implement only documented gaps. |
| Does this launch Cursor implementation? | No. It prepares the documentation package for launch review. |
| Does Atlas approve or merge the PR? | No. Atlas stops at ready-for-review. |

## Cursor readiness standard

Cursor may receive this program only after Bill/Atlas launch it through a program issue or explicit source issue comment.

Cursor assignment must include:

- source issue;
- this readiness doc;
- implementation plan path;
- exact task number;
- file-touch allowlist;
- predecessor/successor;
- validation commands;
- stop condition: GitHub `READY FOR REVIEW`;
- no merge authority;
- no issue close/relabel authority unless explicitly granted.

## Readiness conclusion

Priority #1 is now documented as a coherent next-program candidate.

Readiness state after this package:

- portfolio readiness: ready;
- design readiness: sufficient for launch review;
- implementation-plan readiness: sufficient for Cursor task issue creation after launch;
- execution readiness: structural baseline complete on `main`; ready for Bill/Atlas launch review (see `docs/ops/reports/website-completion-program-1685-launch-readiness.md`).
