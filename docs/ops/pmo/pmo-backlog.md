# PMO Backlog

## Authority

GitHub Issues are the executable source of truth. This file is a repository-owned PMO summary and must be reconciled whenever project state changes.

Documentation is implementation. Every project requires complete requirements, design, implementation planning, applicable DIATAXIS documentation, operations/recovery documentation, a final AS-BUILT record, verification evidence, PMO/queue/dashboard reconciliation, and final closeout evidence.

A project cannot be moved to completed because code merged, a dashboard reached 100%, or Issues were closed. Missing, stale, contradictory, deferred, or unmerged documentation requires:

```text
CLOSEOUT BLOCKED — DOCUMENTATION INCOMPLETE
```

Canonical policy: `docs/governance/PROJECT-DOCUMENTATION-AND-AS-BUILT.md`.

## Current implementation focus

| Project | Lane | Implementer | Current task | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #2615 | Active PMO implementation | Cursor | #2622 | Active |
| #2784 | Active PMO implementation | Claude | #2918 | Active |

ChatGPT / Atlas owns PMO / Engineering. Bill retains Product and Production authority.

## Closeout remediation

| Project | Reason | Required disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1719 | Production promotion completed through PR #3040, but AS-BUILT, PMO records, child state, and repository authority consumers were not reconciled before closure | Keep closeout blocked until the remediation PR, AS-BUILT, final closeout record, PMO/GitHub reconciliation, and independent verification are complete |
| #2678 | Issue/dashboard completion was accepted without a documented repository-wide AS-BUILT and documentation audit in this PMO session | Verify documentation and AS-BUILT before treating closure as authoritative |
| #2779 | Issue/dashboard completion was accepted without a documented repository-wide AS-BUILT and documentation audit in this PMO session | Verify documentation and AS-BUILT before treating closure as authoritative |

## #1719 final production facts

- Candidate: `a68e1390934e7617b7975edc2627a03772fd8e95`
- Production PR: #3040
- Merge SHA: `d6418d769190d56754f22d2d0d4cb46ef1ce8d49`
- AS-BUILT: `docs/ops/as-built/pmo-governance-workflow-automation-1719.md`
- final closeout remediation: `docs/ops/reports/pmo-governance-workflow-automation-final-closeout-1719.md`

Previous statements that #2775 was still active or that #1719 was awaiting Production promotion are superseded.

## Backlog handling rules

- Backlog placement does not authorize implementation.
- Project preparation requires the master Issue, ordered task graph, delivery model, documentation inventory, named AS-BUILT path, validation, rollback, recovery, and explicit Go/No-Go readiness.
- Every applicable DIATAXIS quadrant requires named paths or an explicit justified `Not applicable` disposition.
- Documentation changes must ship with the implementation that changes repository truth.
- Post-merge exceptions return immediately to the implementer of the originating PR.
- Deferred work requires a separate source Issue and must not be counted as incomplete work inside a closed project.
- Historical backlog detail remains available in Git history and project reports; stale historical statements are not current authority.

## Completion gate

PMO may mark a project complete only after independent verification proves:

1. all implementation and required promotion work is merged;
2. all child tasks are terminal;
3. the final AS-BUILT matches the repository and deployed state;
4. all requirements, design, tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation, governance, PMO, operations, rollback, recovery, and monitoring documents are current;
5. queue, dependency, dashboard, role, and GitHub state agree;
6. post-merge verification passed;
7. repository search reveals no stale current-authority statement;
8. final closeout evidence is merged.
