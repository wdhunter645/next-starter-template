# PMO Governance / Workflow Automation Completion Readiness

> **Launch state (2026-07-16):** Program #1719 is Implementation Active under continuous reduced-gate serial authorization. Cursor executes remaining child issues in order after predecessor merge and clean post-merge verification. Cursor stops each child at `READY FOR REVIEW` and may not approve, merge, or mutate issues.

## Purpose

This document converts PMO Backlog ranks 3–10 into a PMO July 2026 future-program readiness package.

Priority #3 is the **PMO Governance / Workflow Automation Completion** group. The group consolidates the former #1411 PMO automation and agent workflow control areas into a bounded program candidate that can later reconcile PMO authority, workflow automation design, Cursor execution contracts, PR readiness, merge/issue mutation rules, queue/wave planning, post-merge closeout, and backlog promotion gates.

## Scope

This readiness package covers these Priority #3 workstreams:

1. PMO July 2026 authority
2. Workflow Automation Design Migration
3. Cursor Continuation and Queue Contract
4. PR Readiness and Batch Review Control
5. Merge and issue mutation policy
6. Queue/Wave Model and Label Planning
7. Post-Merge Closeout Evidence Stabilization
8. PMO Backlog Promotion and Program #1411 Launch Gate

This document owns the PMO readiness decision, project boundaries, source-of-truth map, missing-decision register, Program #1500 overlap reconciliation, stale issue review notes, implementation-readiness classification, and Cursor pre-launch requirements.

This document does not launch implementation, create child issues, authorize Cursor execution, change workflow YAML, change CI scripts, change runtime behavior, mutate #1411 or #1417–#1424, close issues, relabel issues, or supersede the PMO July 2026 operating model.

## Current known truth

- Program #1719 is **Implementation Active** (Bill continuous reduced-gate authorization, 2026-07-16). Active child advances through the serial chain; #1725 closed complete.
- #1411 is closed and completed as a planning/control artifact (historical evidence only).
- #1417–#1424 exist as stale historical task issues with older PMO terminology; they are evidence only and must not be mutated or treated as current source issues.
- Program #1500 closed complete; Task #1725 recorded queue/wave and closeout reconciliation.
- Cursor is the implementation agent for the authorized serial chain. Governance documentation on the project component branch is version-controlled project work and does not require an intermediate human gate solely because governance files change. Promotion to `main` remains Bill/ChatGPT authority.

## Intended final state

After this readiness package is approved, Priority #3 should be usable as a future program-of-work planning package for Cursor assignment once the active queue permits launch.

The intended final state before implementation launch is:

- one PMO July 2026 program candidate with a clear launch-state control statement;
- child-project boundaries for PMO authority, workflow automation, Cursor execution rules, PR readiness, merge/issue mutation policy, queue/wave model, post-merge closeout, and backlog promotion gates;
- a reconciliation map that prevents rebuilding work already completed by Program #1500;
- a stale issue review plan for #1417–#1424;
- an implementation plan that defines task order, file areas, validation, and closeout expectations;
- no requirement for Cursor to infer governance requirements from chat history, historical PMO v2 labels, or stale task issues.

## Child-project readiness inventory

| Priority item | Project name | Current state | Design authority | Implementation plan state | Readiness decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Program #1500 overlap reconciliation

> **Status (Task #1725):** Reconciled 2026-06-19. Program #1500 remains **closed
> complete**. Full tables: `docs/ops/reports/program-1500-queue-wave-reconciliation.md`.

| Area | Program #1500 effect | Priority #3 handling (post-#1725) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Post-merge closeout reliability | Closed complete; satisfies stabilization baseline for ranks 8–9 | **No rebuild.** Task #1726 may scope only remaining implementation candidates |
| Queue/wave model | Partially satisfies closeout sequencing and execution-mode documentation | Task #1725 recorded lane status; wave labels remain planning concepts until Task #1727+ |
| Issue mutation guardrails | Matrix published for Program #1719 closeout posture | Task #005 (#1724) matrix in `docs/ops/reports/issue-mutation-closeout-permission-1724.md`; not reopened by #1725 |
| PR readiness gates | Related to closeout; batch review remains distinct | Task #004 (#1723) owns PR readiness reconciliation |
| Workflow YAML / CI scripts | Protected/sensitive surface | Out of scope for #1725; Task #1726 read-only inventory only unless later authorized |

## Stale issue review note

Issues #1417 through #1424 are stale task issues from the prior #1411 planning cycle. They may contain useful scope evidence, but they are not automatically executable and must not be closed, reopened, relabeled, reassigned, or treated as current source issues from this documentation package.

A later launched Priority #3 program may:

- cite #1417–#1424 as historical evidence;
- map their useful content into new current child task issues;
- leave them unchanged if they are superseded;
- propose a separate operator-approved hygiene action if mutation is required.

## Missing-decision register

| Decision | Needed before | Current default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whether Priority #3 uses docs-only tasks first or includes workflow/script tasks | Launch issue creation | Docs-first; protected files require explicit later authorization |
| Whether #1417–#1424 are reused, superseded, or left historical | Task 001 / Task 008 | **Resolved for Task 001 (#1720):** historical evidence only; no mutation |
| Whether Program #1500 fully satisfies rank 9 | Task 006 (#1725) | **Resolved:** baseline satisfied; deferred register items are CI maintenance, not incomplete #1500 scope |
| Whether queue/wave labels become real labels or planning concepts only | Task 006 (#1725) | **Resolved for planning:** concepts only until Task #1727+ explicitly authorizes implementation |
| Whether Cursor may mutate issues during closeout | Task 005 (#1724) | **Resolved:** default deny; matrix in `docs/ops/reports/issue-mutation-closeout-permission-1724.md` |
| Whether workflow automation changes touch `.github/workflows/**` or `scripts/ci/**` | Task 007 | Out of scope until explicit implementation authorization and trusted review |

## Launch preconditions

Launch preconditions for Program #1719 were **satisfied on 2026-07-16** by Bill’s continuous reduced-gate authorization on #1719. Remaining operating rules:

1. Cursor receives one child task at a time unless Bill/Atlas explicitly approve parallel execution.
2. After a predecessor PR merges and post-merge verification is clean, Cursor may start the next authorized child without another launch prompt.
3. Protected workflow/script changes require explicit trusted-reviewer expectations before implementation.
4. Issue mutation permissions remain denied unless a current source issue explicitly grants them.
5. `#1723` and `#1724` are component-branch documentation tasks under `component-auto-integration`; governance-doc edits alone do not create an intermediate human gate. Promotion to `main` remains Bill/ChatGPT authority.

Historical planning-era preconditions (queue behind #1255/#1685/#1700) are superseded for this program by the 2026-07-16 authorization on #1719.

## Readiness conclusion

Priority #3 is an **Implementation Active** PMO July 2026 program with master issue #1719 and child task issues #1720 through #1727.

Cursor is authorized to execute the remaining serial chain under #1719 continuous reduced-gate rules. After #1724 component integration, next authorized child is #1726 (#1725 remains complete and is skipped).
