# AI Review Access

## Purpose

Provide a **read-only, token-protected, live inspection surface** so Atlas/ChatGPT can review authenticated LGFC page structure and content without weakening normal `/fanclub` or `/admin` session authentication.

AI review access is **disabled by default** and intended for short, operator-controlled preview or review windows.

## Environment variables

Configure these in Cloudflare Pages environment settings. **Never commit values to the repository.**

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AI_REVIEW_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch. When absent or false, all AI review routes fail closed. |
| `AI_REVIEW_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Long random secret used as `?token=` query parameter. |
| `AI_REVIEW_ALLOW_ADMIN` | `false` | When false, `/_ai-review/admin` and `/api/_ai-review/page-snapshot?path=/admin` are blocked. |

## Review URLs

When enabled with a valid token:

```text
/_ai-review/home?token=<AI_REVIEW_TOKEN>
/_ai-review/fanclub?token=<AI_REVIEW_TOKEN>
/_ai-review/admin?token=<AI_REVIEW_TOKEN>          # only when AI_REVIEW_ALLOW_ADMIN=true
/api/_ai-review/page-snapshot?path=/fanclub&token=<AI_REVIEW_TOKEN>
```

Source pages live under `src/app/ai-review/` and are exported to `/_ai-review/` during postbuild so Next.js private-folder rules do not block routing.

## Security constraints

1. Missing/invalid token → **404** (disabled) or **403** (enabled but unauthorized) from both the Cloudflare Pages `/_ai-review/*` edge guard and the snapshot API.
2. Token must **not** appear in HTML, JSON responses, logs, telemetry, or test snapshots.
3. Review URLs pass the token in the `?token=` query parameter per issue #1973; operators should treat preview access as short-lived and rotate the token after review.
4. No mutation endpoints, D1 dumps, impersonation, or environment/secret dumps through review mode.
5. Admin review surfaces are read-only summaries; publish/delete/export controls are not active.
6. Normal member login and `/fanclub` / `/admin` cookie auth are unchanged.

## Runtime model

- **Edge guard:** `functions/_ai-review/[[path]].ts` validates the token before static HTML is served.
- **Client gate:** review pages call `/api/_ai-review/page-snapshot` to hydrate read-only content; unauthorized clients render empty output.
- **Export path:** source pages live in `src/app/ai-review/` and postbuild renames `out/ai-review` to `out/_ai-review`.

## Operator usage (preview-first)

1. Enable review on a **preview** deployment first.
2. Set `AI_REVIEW_ENABLED=true` and configure `AI_REVIEW_TOKEN` in Cloudflare.
3. Share review URLs with Atlas/Bill only through secure channels (not in issues, PRs, or repo files).
4. Enable `AI_REVIEW_ALLOW_ADMIN=true` only when admin layout review is explicitly required.
5. **Disable immediately** after review: set `AI_REVIEW_ENABLED=false` and rotate `AI_REVIEW_TOKEN`.

## Disable immediately

```text
AI_REVIEW_ENABLED=false
```

Optionally unset or rotate `AI_REVIEW_TOKEN`. Redeploy or update the Cloudflare environment so the change takes effect without code changes.

## Implementation map

| Surface | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Shared guard | `src/lib/aiReviewAccess.ts` |
| Edge route guard | `functions/_ai-review/[[path]].ts` |
| Snapshot API | `functions/api/_ai-review/page-snapshot.ts` |
| Live review pages | `src/app/ai-review/{home,fanclub,admin}/page.tsx` |
| Tests | `tests/ai-review-access.test.ts` |
