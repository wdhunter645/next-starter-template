# PMO Governance / Workflow Automation Completion Implementation Plan

> **Construction state (2026-07-16, resynchronized #2775):** Program #1719 documentation construction on `component/pmo-governance-workflow-automation` is complete through Task #1727 (`docs/ops/reports/pmo-governance-workflow-automation-closeout-1727.md`). Task #1725 was previously complete and was not rerun. Cursor may not approve, merge to `main`, close, reopen, or relabel issues. Bill/Atlas acceptance and Bill/ChatGPT-approved promotion to `main` remain outstanding; #2775 prepares a replacement candidate after the component branch fell behind current `main`.

## Purpose

Define the future Cursor implementation sequence for the PMO Priority #3 program candidate: **PMO Governance / Workflow Automation Completion**.

This plan packages PMO Backlog ranks 3–10 into bounded implementation tasks so Cursor can execute after launch authorization without inferring governance requirements from chat history, stale PMO v2 terminology, historical #1411 child issues, or partially superseded Program #1500 work.

## Scope

This plan covers:

- PMO July 2026 authority reconciliation;
- workflow automation design migration and gap review;
- Cursor continuation and queue contract hardening;
- PR readiness and batch review control;
- merge and issue mutation policy;
- queue/wave model and label planning;
- post-merge closeout evidence stabilization reconciliation;
- PMO backlog promotion and launch-gate rules;
- final operator handoff and launch-control package.

This plan does not authorize this documentation PR to change workflows, CI scripts, runtime code, route files, package files, issue labels, issue states, stale #1417–#1424 issues, or implementation child issues.

## Current known truth

- Program #1719 documentation construction is **complete on the component branch** through Task #1727 (2026-07-16).
- Child chain disposition: #1720 → #1721 → #1722 → #1723 → #1724 → (#1725 complete, skipped) → #1726 → #1727. Tasks #1723/#1724 used `component-auto-integration` (no intermediate human gate for governance docs alone).
- #1411 is closed complete as a planning/control artifact (historical evidence only).
- #1417–#1424 are stale historical task issues and must not be treated as current executable source issues; do not mutate them.
- #1500 is closed complete; Task #1725 recorded queue/wave and closeout reconciliation evidence.
- Cursor remains the implementation agent for any Bill-authorized follow-on; promotion to `main` is Bill/ChatGPT only.
- Deferred workflow/CI candidates are listed in `#1726` / `#1727` reports and require new source issues.

## Intended final state

At the end of this program:

1. PMO July 2026 authority is internally consistent across operating model, registry, backlog, and execution contracts.
2. Workflow automation design is documented as repository authority and gaps are classified before code/workflow changes.
3. Cursor continuation, stop, review-handoff, and queue rules are explicit and current.
4. PR readiness and batch-review controls preserve Bill/ChatGPT review and merge authority.
5. Merge and issue mutation rules are explicit, auditable, and safe for project/program source issues.
6. Queue/wave planning is reconciled against Program #1500 and converted only where still needed.
7. Post-merge closeout evidence stabilization avoids rebuilding completed #1500 work.
8. PMO backlog promotion rules consistently define when project drafts become programs, issues, and Cursor assignments.
9. Cursor stops each task at GitHub `READY FOR REVIEW`; ChatGPT does not self-approve or self-merge.

## Cursor execution rules

Cursor may execute only after a current source issue explicitly authorizes the specific task.

Each task issue must include parent program, predecessor, successor, exact scope, out-of-scope list, file-touch allowlist, source documents, acceptance criteria, validation requirements, stop condition `GitHub READY FOR REVIEW`, and no merge/issue-mutation authority unless explicitly granted.

Cursor must reconcile before building. Existing PMO docs, governance docs, workflow automation docs, PR rules, closeout protocols, queue/dependency maps, and Program #1500 evidence must be inspected before creating deltas.

## Validation model

Each implementation PR must run checks relevant to its changed files and record exact outcomes in the PR body.

Expected validation categories:

- documentation header checks for docs changes;
- governance docs consistency checks when governance files change;
- PR process/readiness checks when PR governance documents change;
- read-only workflow/script inventory when `.github/workflows/**` or `scripts/ci/**` are referenced;
- no workflow YAML or CI script changes unless a future source issue explicitly authorizes that task;
- no GitHub issue mutation unless a future source issue explicitly grants that authority;
- no ZIP file in repo root;
- one source issue line in the PR body;
- exact file-touch allowlist alignment.

## Launch gate

**Satisfied for Program #1719 on 2026-07-16.** Bill recorded continuous reduced-gate serial authorization on #1719. Remaining child tasks execute under that authorization without a new launch decision between tasks when predecessor merge and post-merge verification are clean.

Default stop condition per child: GitHub `READY FOR REVIEW`.

Protected review points for intermediate governance-doc gates on `#1723`/`#1724` are **obsolete**. Material stop/escalation conditions remain those listed on #1719 (authority conflict, allowlist overrun, unauthorized protected-surface change, material design/priority decision, unremediable required checks, unclean predecessor). Promotion to `main` remains Bill/ChatGPT authority.

## Closeout rules

- Cursor does not approve PRs.
- Cursor does not merge PRs.
- Cursor does not close, reopen, or relabel GitHub issues unless a source issue explicitly grants that authority.
- ChatGPT does not self-approve ChatGPT-authored PRs.
- Source issue closeout occurs only after merge verification and post-merge validator state are clean.
- Program closeout requires Task 008 (#1727) evidence and explicit Bill/ChatGPT acceptance.

## Readiness conclusion

This implementation plan is the active Cursor execution sequence for Program #1719.

Status: `implementation-active`.

Execution: authorized. Active child #1720; continuous serial continuation through #1727 subject to predecessor merge/post-merge cleanliness and protected review points.
