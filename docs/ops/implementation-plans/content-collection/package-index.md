# Content Collection Package Index

## Purpose

Navigate Content Collection implementation packages enriched from Drive intake drafts under `_incoming/drive-drafts/content-collection/` and now promoted into repository-operational planning docs.

These are **operational envelopes** for future Cursor tasks. They become executable only when a scoped GitHub Issue authorizes work and Bill / ChatGPT approve the relevant launch gate.

**Phase 0 closeout:** `docs/ops/reports/content-collection-phase0-promotion-closeout-2365.md`

**Phase 1 prep:** `docs/ops/implementation-plans/content-collection/phase1-launch-prep.md`

| Project Lane Issue Body Pack | Paste parallel-control blocks from parallel matrix when Bill authorizes |
| Per-Lane Task Issue Body Pack | Paste per-task bodies when Bill authorizes |

## Current known truth

- Phase 0 docs promotion (#2360–#2365) completed via PR #2427.
- Phase 1 preparation issue set is #2431–#2438.
- #2431 is the prepared Phase 1 Go / NoGo control issue.
- Rejected target roots remain `docs/ops/programs/` and `docs/reference/website/content-collection/` per #2360.
- All four feature routes **exist** on `main` with member auth; packages document gaps vs CC-001/CC-002 and implementation allowlists.
- Intake `.docx` remains on `atlas/drive-draft-intake-2367` only.
- Feature code remains blocked until `CONTRACT-FROZEN: content-asset-model v1` is posted and ChatGPT verifies downstream release.
- CI-001 / CI-002 tooling is Phase 1 work only after CI Stage 0 current-state gap analysis.

## Procedure

1. Read #2360 audit disposition before implementation.
2. Read `phase1-launch-prep.md` and #2431 before Phase 1 Go / NoGo.
3. Open the package or control/support doc for the assigned child issue.
4. Re-verify paths on `main` before edits.
5. Respect `CONTRACT-FROZEN: content-asset-model v1` for GAL/LIB/MEM code PRs.
6. Serialize CLUB-001 shell edits with other fanclub lanes.
7. Post `CHATGPT HANDOFF` when authority conflicts remain.

## Execution

Package, control, and support enrichment (#2361–#2364) stopped at Phase 0 docs. Phase 1 issues #2431–#2438 are prepared but blocked pending Go / NoGo. Code implementation requires a launched child issue with an explicit allowlist and validation plan.
