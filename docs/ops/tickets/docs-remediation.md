# Documentation Remediation Ticket (A+B)

## Objective
Execute documentation remediation workstreams A and B:

1. Fix `docs/as-built/cloudflare-frontend.md` — correct FanClub logo link per canonical design
2. Fix `docs/reference/design/dashboard.md` — remove Supabase/Vercel references, align to D1
3. Align all architecture references to Cloudflare D1 + Backblaze B2
4. Add required headers to docs missing them (CI compliance)
