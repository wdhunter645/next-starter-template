# Incident Severity Model (MASTER)

## Purpose
Standardize how incidents are classified and handled.

## Severity Levels
P0 – Critical: site down, data loss risk
P1 – High: major feature broken
P2 – Medium: partial functionality
P3 – Low: cosmetic/minor issues

Severity determines urgency and response.
