# Accelerated Webpage Implementations Log (No-PR, Direct-to-Main, CF Pages Deploy)

**Project:** Lou Gehrig Fan Club website (Next.js on Cloudflare Pages)  
**Thread window:** 2026-02-09 (America/New_York)  
**Purpose of this document:** Preserve *full operational context* of how we executed accelerated, high-velocity webpage fixes **without PRs**, why we did it, what we changed, what broke, how we recovered, and the exact operational rules we followed so we don’t re-litigate this work later.

---

## 1) Operating Mode (Explicit)

### 1.1 Goal
**“Webpages 100% deployed today.”**  
This phase is strictly about **production UI behavior** and **making the site match the locked design**. Governance workflows, PR gates, and repo housekeeping are intentionally deprioritized until the site is stable and usable.

### 1.2 No-PR Approach (Direct Deploy)
We used a “no PR” approach on purpose:

- Changes were made locally in Codespaces.
- We ran `npm run build` to verify the build.
- We **committed directly to `main`** and pushed.
- Cloudflare Pages deploy is triggered off `main`.

**Why:** speed, reduced friction, avoid PR toolchain overhead when the immediate objective is a live UI fix.

### 1.3 “ZIP Is Source of Truth” vs “Live Repo Is Source of Truth”
Historically, ZIP uploads were used as the authoritative snapshot for change work.

In this accelerated workflow:
- The **GitHub repository `main` becomes the immediate operational truth** for Cloudflare deployment.
- We still treat ZIP snapshots as “source of truth” artifacts when uploaded, but the deploy reality is `main`.

Operationally:
- If a ZIP is uploaded for a future phase, treat it as the primary baseline for subsequent work in that phase.
- For this accelerated phase, **deploy outcome is bound to `main`**.

## 2) What We Were Fixing (Problem Statement)

### 2.1 Primary UI Failure
Header became unusable after prior changes:
- Giant invisible hitbox around logo blocked navigation.
- Buttons became unclickable or overlapped.
- Hamburger menu positioning/regression (opening in wrong place).
- Logo size/placement regressed repeatedly across prior implementations.

### 2.2 Additional Symptoms (Observed During Build/Deploy)
- Local build succeeded but a “marker” grep check failed:
  - `grep -RIn "hard constrained hitbox" out .next` returned **marker NOT found**.
  - This did **not** mean the build failed; it meant the expected literal text wasn’t present in output.
- ESLint warnings existed (no build failure), e.g. `no-img-element`, hook deps warnings, unused eslint directives.
- Cloudflare initially appeared to not deploy new header behavior even after local build passed, but this was due to Git push issues (non-fast-forward) and later deployment timing/caching confusion.

## 3) Key Timeline (What Happened, In Order)

> Note: Times below reflect terminal output and commit history from the thread. Exact wall-clock timestamps are less important than causal order.

### 3.1 Local changes prepared, build OK, push rejected
We modified header CSS/TSX:
- `src/components/Header.module.css`
- `src/components/Header.tsx`
- `src/components/MemberHeader.module.css`
- `src/components/MemberHeader.tsx`

Local build:
- `npm run build` succeeded.

Push:
- `git push origin main` rejected with “fetch first / non-fast-forward”
- Remote `main` had new commits the local branch didn’t have.

### 3.2 Rebase attempt created conflicts
We executed:
- `git fetch origin`
- `git rebase origin/main`

Conflicts:
- `src/components/Header.module.css`
- `src/components/MemberHeader.module.css`

This confirmed the remote head had diverged from local assumptions.

### 3.3 Recovery move: replace conflicted CSS with clean final CSS
During the rebase conflict resolution, we replaced the conflicted CSS files with a clean “hard constrained hitbox” version.

This introduced the “hard constrained logo area” pattern:
- `overflow: hidden`
- container `pointer-events: none`
- only the actual logo link `pointer-events: auto`
- fixed width of the logo hitbox (72px)

The rebase was completed and pushed successfully.

### 3.4 Confirmed deployment commit
At that point we confirmed GitHub `main` at:

- `117e2ad` — `recovery change-ops: constrain header logo hitbox + rebuild`

Cloudflare build succeeded; UI improved:
- Buttons restored + clickable
- Logo became too small / moved / unreadable
- Hamburger/menu behavior partially restored

### 3.5 Captured a “known-good” snapshot artifact
To prevent losing working state again, we created a recovery snapshot file:

- `reports/recovery/header-known-good-20260209T111755Z.txt`

Important limitation:
- That snapshot captured **CSS**, but did **not** capture TSX contents as intended (we discovered later it only contained CSS blocks and ended early).

Still useful:
- It preserves the CSS baseline that restored clickability and eliminated the giant hitbox regression.

### 3.6 Attempt to group hamburger with buttons introduced a scripting bug (but changes still landed)
A Python patch script intended to move the hamburger into the centered nav group failed with:

- `SyntaxError: f-string: expecting a valid expression after '{'`

Cause:
- JSX strings include `{/* comment */}` which contains `{` and `}` that collide with Python f-string interpolation rules.

Despite that error:
- A subsequent commit did land:

- `3ad1741` — `feature: group header hamburger with centered nav buttons`

However, the JSX ended up in a fragile state:
- `<div className={styles.right}>` got shoved inside `<nav>` with ugly formatting.
- It “worked” but was not clean or stable.

### 3.7 Tooling discovery: ripgrep not installed
We attempted to search repo history and patterns with `rg` and received:

- `bash: rg: command not found`

Outcome:
- We relied on:
  - `sed`
  - `grep`
  - `ls`
  - `find`
  - `git log`
  - direct file inspection

### 3.8 “Do we have the old non-sticky logo / overlay design in repo?”
We inspected:
- `src/components/SiteHeaderOLD.tsx` exists.
- Snapshot file exists.
- No obvious “floating logo overlay” implementation found via search (due to missing `rg` and limited snapshot contents).

Conclusion:
- The current repo state shows the logo **inside the sticky header** (verified by reading `Header.tsx` and `MemberHeader.tsx`).
- To recreate the “logo as a separate object” behavior, we must re-implement it intentionally and lock it down.

---

## 4) The Current Reality (As of the end of this log)

### 4.1 What’s working
- Cloudflare builds are succeeding again.
- Header buttons are visible and clickable.
- Hamburger is now visually grouped with buttons (at least partially).
- Hitbox regression was eliminated using CSS constraints.

### 4.2 What’s still wrong / incomplete
- Logo is too small and unreadable.
- The desired “classic” header layout keeps regressing:
  - big readable logo pinned left/top
  - logo overlaps hero slightly
  - header buttons grouped and centered
  - hamburger dropdown anchored under itself
  - sticky header + non-sticky logo behavior (logo disappears when scrolling, header remains)

### 4.3 The core issue: repeated regression due to lack of a locked design spec
We keep re-solving the same header problem because:
- The design invariants aren’t encoded as a single authoritative spec.
- Implementations rewrite CSS/TSX differently each time.
- Fixes are often reactive (hitbox, clickability), then layout regresses.

---

## 5) Operational Rules We Used (Keep These)

### 5.1 Deploy method
- Commit to `main` triggers Cloudflare Pages deploy.
- Always run:
  - `npm run build` before pushing.
- Use `curl -I` against production endpoints for quick sanity checks.
  - This proves reachability and can reveal caching/csp headers,
  - but it does not guarantee UI changed (HTML may not reflect CSS/layout changes directly).

### 5.2 Recovery discipline
- When conflicts occur:
  - Rebase on `origin/main`
  - Resolve deterministically (replace full CSS file if needed)
  - Build
  - Push
- Always capture a recovery snapshot after a known-good restore.
  - Snapshot must include the TSX files and CSS (verify it actually wrote them).

### 5.3 Script safety
- Do not use Python f-strings to emit JSX that contains `{}`.
  - JSX comment blocks `{/* ... */}` will break f-string formatting.
- Prefer:
  - heredocs for full-file writes, OR
  - Python writing raw triple-quoted strings without f-string interpolation.

### 5.4 Tooling assumptions
- Don’t assume `rg` exists.
- If we need `rg`, install it explicitly or use `grep -R` alternatives.

---

## 6) Next Work (Immediate)
We proceed with the final header layout stabilization:
- restore large readable logo behavior
- keep grouped nav + hamburger centered
- ensure dropdown anchors under hamburger
- lock the design in a single spec (see `docs/header-memberheader-logo-banner-design-lock.md`)
