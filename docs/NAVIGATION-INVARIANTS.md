# LGFC — Navigation Invariants (Authoritative)

This document is **authoritative**. If any UI or doc contradicts this file, this file wins.

## Global header (public site)
**Header nav labels and order are fixed:**
1. Weekly Matchup → `/weekly`
2. Milestones → `/milestones`
3. Charities → `/charities`
4. News & Q&A → `/news`
5. Calendar → `/calendar`
6. Join → `/member`

## Hamburger menu (global rules)
Hamburger menus list **ONLY standalone pages**.

Hamburger menus must NEVER include:
- Home page sections (e.g., “Charities section”, “Events section”, “Social Wall”)
- Footer-only links (Privacy, Terms)
- Join or Login
- Member-only header buttons

### Visitor hamburger (standalone pages only)
- Home (MOBILE ONLY)
- About
- Contact
- Support (mailto)
- Store (external)

### Desktop/tablet hamburger rule
- Desktop/tablet hamburger does **NOT** include Home.
- Home may appear on mobile only.

## Footer (footer-only)
- Privacy → `/privacy`
- Terms → `/terms`
- Admin → `/admin`

## Support + Store
- Support is a mailto link (not a page unless explicitly implemented later).
- Store is an external link.

## Search
Search appears as a header button **only** if an actual `/search` page exists.
Search must never be placed into the hamburger unless explicitly locked later.
