## Lessons Learned

### Documentation
1. **Consolidate overlapping guides regularly** - We had 5+ auth guides that should have been merged sooner
2. **Archive completion reports promptly** - Historical docs clutter the root directory
3. **Use consistent formatting** - Makes cross-referencing easier

### Security
1. **Never commit .env files** - Even briefly exposing secrets requires full credential rotation
2. **Use .env.example as template** - Prevents accidental secret commits
3. **Document credential rotation** - Security incidents need repeatable response process

### Developer Experience
1. **Codespaces token configuration is critical** - Default read-only token prevents git push
2. **Helper scripts reduce friction** - fix-git-auth.sh saves developers time
3. **Clear getting-started docs are essential** - START_HERE.md approach works well

### Process
1. **After-action reports are valuable** - But need to be archived to avoid clutter
2. **Small PRs are better** - Surgical changes easier to review and merge
3. **Test infrastructure should be built early** - We're adding it retroactively

### Testing & Quality
1. **Manual verification works for MVP** - But automated tests needed for long-term
2. **Build and lint checks catch most issues** - Should be part of CI from day one
3. **Deployment verification checklist should be automated** - Repeatable is better than manual
