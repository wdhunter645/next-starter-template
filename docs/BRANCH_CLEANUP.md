## Merge Conflict Resolution

The main branch had a merge conflict in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` caused by:
- Duplicate closing braces
- Properties outside the main JSON object
- Invalid JSON structure

**Resolution Applied**: Used the clean version from `copilot/fix-codespaces-instability` which:
- Removes the malformed JSON syntax
- Keeps the proper structure with `remoteEnv` and `postCreateCommand`
- Removes the complex `secrets` and `gh auth` setup that was causing issues

## Files Changed in This PR

1. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Resolved merge conflict
2. `docs/DEVCONTAINER_FIX.md` - Added documentation about the fix
