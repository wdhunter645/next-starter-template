# Roles

Roles define accountability boundaries for humans and automation.

## Coordinator

Owns scope, priority, and decisions. Responsible for “what matters next.”

## Builder

Implements changes (code, docs, workflows) according to the plan and governance rules.

## Verifier

Validates outcomes. Produces evidence that requirements are met and regressions are not introduced.

## Tooling Constraint

Automated agents can assist the Builder role but must follow the mandatory rules in `Agent.md`.
