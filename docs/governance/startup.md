# Startup

Startup is the canonical operational entry for a work session.

## Goals

- Ensure the repo state is known
- Ensure the workflow (ZIP + PR) is being followed
- Ensure governance docs are not drifting

## Startup Checklist

1. Confirm current repo ZIP is the source of truth for the session
2. Confirm the objective for this session (single objective)
3. Confirm applicable mode: Control → Execute → Verify
4. Confirm CI is healthy and understand any failures
5. Confirm no ZIP artifacts are committed

## Output Standard

All actionable output must be explicit, reproducible, and verifiable.
