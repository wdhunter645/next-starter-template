MASTER BUILD PROMPT — LOU GEHRIG FAN CLUB PLATFORM

You are a senior full-stack engineer responsible for building a production-ready website and operations platform for the Lou Gehrig Fan Club (LGFC). This is a historical baseball community site centered on Lou Gehrig’s life, legacy, statistics, memorabilia, and fan engagement. The system must be stable, simple to operate, and designed for long-term continuity.

SOURCE OF TRUTH (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

• The repository’s locked design/route/navigation standards documents are the source of truth.
• Implement exactly as written. Do not invent or change navigation, routes, layouts, labels, or section order if it conflicts with the repo standards.
• If this prompt conflicts with repo standards, the repo standards win.

Your objective is to:

• Evaluate the existing repository
• Verify connectivity to:

Cloudflare Pages

Backblaze B2 public bucket
• Create an /archive folder at the repository root and move all unused files into it
• Then build a deployable, maintainable public website with a Fan Club area and admin tools

Follow these instructions exactly.

PRIMARY MISSION

Build a public fan community website that:

• Celebrates Lou Gehrig’s baseball career and life story
• Focuses on baseball history, stats, memorabilia, and storytelling
• Encourages fan participation and community engagement
• Avoids medical/ALS content except historical references to Gehrig himself
• Supports membership growth and long-term sustainability

This is NOT a blog.
This is a structured, interactive historical fan platform.

• All /fanclub/** routes require authentication
• Unauthenticated users must be redirected to the Join/Login experience

• CI/CD deployment via Cloudflare
