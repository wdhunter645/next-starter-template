# Agent Team

## Purpose

This document defines durable repository roles and maps current team members and systems to them. Broad policy uses role names so team-member, vendor, model, runtime, or tool changes do not require widespread documentation edits.

An agent or system may act only through the roles currently assigned to it. A named agent does not permanently own authority merely because it currently fills a role.

LGFC agents are operating team members. They communicate directly through the canonical GitHub communication workflow whenever it is available. Human relay through Product Authority is the least-desired fallback and does not replace durable agent-to-agent routing.

Queue precedence, team priority namespaces, Project Graduation, and the universal collaboration method are defined in `docs/governance/WORK-QUEUES-AND-COLLABORATION.md`.

## Durable roles

| Role | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Product Authority | Product outcome, priority, cost, business decisions, final completed-product review |
| PMO / Engineering | Requirements, design, architecture, acceptance criteria, planning, Sandbox authority, implementation Go, aggregate project verification |
| Implementation / Operations | Development and Promotion Candidate execution, testing, remediation, integration, deployment execution, implementation handoff, and closeout-packet evidence; no independent task acceptance |
| PR Approver / Engineering | Independent validation that work meets design, acceptance, repository, and promotion requirements |
| Administration & Communications | Evidence, routing, acknowledgments, escalation, repository-state reconciliation, hold/resume, reporting, WORK-controlled closeout, parent reconciliation, successor release, and authorized transaction execution |
| Day-2 Operations | Production monitoring, incident classification, containment, recovery strategy, operational hold release |
| Deterministic CI | Machine-provable checks, evidence, eligible non-main integration, and bounded authorized automation |

No role may self-approve work when independent review is required. Implementation / Operations may perform eligible administrative task closeout only after the required independent review, integration, validation, and post-integration evidence already exist.

## WORK task and project acceptance ownership

WORK holds the PMO / Engineering and Administration & Communications responsibility for evidence-backed task and project acceptance, closeout, parent reconciliation, and exception handling.

For every implementation child that requires judgment, WORK independently reviews the live source Issue, final diff, required tests and failure paths, checks, review dispositions, integration identity, post-integration evidence, documentation, rollback readiness, and unresolved exceptions. WORK records one controlling disposition when assurance is required:

- `ACCEPT` — reconcile/close the child and reconcile the parent when a substantive acceptance gate applies;
- `HOLD` — record the true dependency or protected stop, owner, evidence needed, and release condition;
- `REMEDIATE` — return bounded defects to the originating implementer and keep the affected transition fail-closed;
- `VERIFY MORE` — identify the missing proof and keep the affected transition fail-closed.

After a Project or Program is Active with a prepared child graph, eligible agents self-claim the next package-complete child under standing parent authority (#3145). WORK does not act as a routine per-task dispatcher or mandatory “release” gate between already-authorized children. Deterministic CI may execute mechanically provable closeout mutations, but WORK owns substantive acceptance decisions and verifies resulting repository state when judgment is required. WORK must not independently approve or verify a PR that WORK implemented. In that case, another authorized independent reviewer supplies the review evidence and Bill retains every required protected Product or Production decision.

`team:*` labels are durable Team ownership. `agent:*` labels are current execution claims only and must not be added merely to make an Issue visible.

## Recognized agent products

This inventory represents each distinct LGFC agent product separately rather than collapsing them into a generic AI-agent label (#3052). Adding a product to this inventory does not, by itself, grant implementation, review, approval, closeout, or mutation authority — authority comes only from the role mapping below and an explicit source Issue.

| Product | Status | Distinct from | Product-specific rules file | `run startup` applies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Work (OpenAI) | Active — LGFC team member | Ordinary Chat (same model family, outside the delivery chain) | `docs/ops/ai/WORK-RULES.md` | Yes |
| Codex (OpenAI) | Inactive for implementation; startup contract only | Work | `docs/ops/ai/CODEX-RULES.md` | Yes (orientation only; grants no implementation authority) |
| Cursor Local / Cursor Cloud | Active — LGFC team member | — | `docs/ops/ai/CURSOR-RULES.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `AGENTS.md` (Cloud) | Yes (existing bootstrap, unchanged by #3052) |
| Claude Code (Anthropic) | Active — LGFC team member | Claude (conversational) | `docs/ops/ai/CLAUDE-CODE-RULES.md` | Yes |
| Claude (Anthropic, conversational) | Supporting/advisory only — no durable role | Claude Code | none | No — outside the operational delivery chain; state this plainly if asked to perform repository work |
| Notion | Supporting tool — controlled-document workspace | — | none | No — not a session-based operating agent; a data/document surface used by role holders (primarily Administration & Communications / Work) |
| GitHub Actions and repository automation | Active — Deterministic CI | — | n/a (workflow-defined) | n/a |

## Current team mapping

| Current member or system | Assigned roles |
| --- | --- |
| Bill | Product Authority; Day-2 Operations; alternate protected approval when recorded |
| Work | PMO / Engineering; PR Approver / Engineering; Administration & Communications; Day-2 Operations coordination and Tier 2 specialist support |
| Cursor Local | Implementation / Operations; Day-2 Operations remediation implementation |
| Claude Code | Implementation / Operations; PR Approver / Engineering (only for work Claude Code did not itself implement) |
| GitHub Actions and repository automation | Deterministic CI; Administration & Communications transport/evidence; authorized Day-2 monitoring and bounded remediation |
| Repository runner and routing controller | Administration & Communications control-plane infrastructure; host/service maintained by Day-2 Operations |
| Codex | Inactive for LGFC implementation unless Product Authority records future reauthorization and role assignment |
| Claude (conversational) | No durable repository role; bounded collaboration only under the Universal collaboration boundary below |
| Notion | No durable repository role; controlled-document workspace supporting Administration & Communications / Work evidence and record-keeping; no GitHub mutation authority |

`Work` is the current name for the product this table and repository history previously called `ChatGPT` (#3052). The role contract is unchanged; only the product name is reconciled to match the actual OpenAI product performing this work. Ordinary conversational Chat is not a row in this table because it holds no durable repository role.

Future agents and systems may be assigned compatible roles through an approved mapping change or project manifest. Changing the mapping does not change the role contract.

## Mapping rules

- Canonical policy names durable roles, not preferred vendors, models, or agent products.
- Current member names belong in this mapping, a project manifest, or a bounded runtime/compatibility document.
- A role reassignment changes who may act; it does not alter the authority or evidence required for the action.
- One member may hold multiple roles, but required independent review and separation-of-duty constraints still apply.
- A member that implemented child work must not be the sole independent reviewer of that work or the sole project/master closeout auditor.

## Team communication

- Operating team members communicate directly through structured GitHub events on the relevant source Issue.
- The target role holder acknowledges and acts through the same durable workflow.
- Collaboration adds a bounded participant; it does not change the source Issue's queue, priority, or execution owner.
- PR reviews, checks, and threads provide technical evidence but do not replace the source-Issue collaboration or routing event.
- Product Authority is not expected to copy, interpret, or relay routine assignments, findings, remediation requests, acknowledgments, resumes, status, or completion messages.
- Human relay through Product Authority is the least-desired fallback when the canonical channel is unavailable or Product Authority intervention is intentionally required.
- Any externally relayed decision must be written back to GitHub by the responsible role holder before repository work depends on it.

## Lane topology

### Horizontal lanes

- PMO / Engineering
- Implementation / Operations
- Day-2 Operations

### Vertical lane

- Administration & Communications

Development and Promotion Candidate are technical profiles inside the conversational Implementation / Operations lane.

Lanes define authority. The separate Operations, PMO, and Engineering work queues define sequencing under `WORK-QUEUES-AND-COLLABORATION.md`.

## Daily work precedence

### Cursor Local

1. Actionable `team:operations` Issues requiring remediation (normal Operations executor; self-claim by eligibility).
2. Active `team:pmo` project/program children under standing parent authority (self-claim next eligible child).
3. Bounded Engineering collaboration only when explicitly requested — Cursor is not a normal `team:engineering` executor.

Operations Monitoring and Hold Issues receive required interval updates but do not block Active PMO work. An actionable Operations Issue interrupts ordinary PMO implementation at the nearest safe checkpoint.

### Claude Code

1. Active `team:pmo` project/program children under standing parent authority (self-claim when eligible) — operating in parallel with, not in place of, Cursor Local; each claimed task has exactly one executor.
2. `team:engineering` Pipeline and Active Engineering work (normal Engineering executor; self-claim by eligibility).
3. Independent PR review (PR Approver / Engineering) for work Claude Code did not itself implement, when requested.
4. Bounded `team:operations` support only when an Operations Issue is explicitly escalated beyond normal Cursor-only handling — Claude does not normally self-claim the Operations queue; escalation does not create a fourth Team or change Team ownership.

Operations Monitoring and Hold Issues receive required interval updates but do not block Active PMO work.

### Work

1. Numbered Operations Issues when assigned for Tier 2 specialist support, Engineering judgment, independent review, or coordination.
2. PMO preparation, graduation, monitoring, assurance, substantive acceptance, exception handling, and closeout — including project-closeout administrative tasks.
3. Engineering Pipeline preparation selected by Engineering priority.

This precedence orders each member's available capacity. It does not merge team queues or transfer source-Issue ownership.

## Authority boundaries

| Decision or action | Owning role |
| --- | --- |
| Product requirements, priority, cost, business Go/No-Go | Product Authority |
| Design, architecture, acceptance, project plan, Sandbox decision | PMO / Engineering |
| Launch-package completeness, Project Graduation recommendation, and implementation Go | PMO / Engineering |
| Scoped implementation and remediation | Implementation / Operations |
| PR review and approval | PR Approver / Engineering |
| Eligible non-main integration | Deterministic CI under Delivery policy or PR Approver / Engineering when protected |
| Assigned project-child or child-remediation closeout decision after required evidence exists | Assigned Implementation / Operations role holder |
| Assigned task closeout transaction | Deterministic CI first; assigned Implementation / Operations role holder as fallback under bounded delegated Administration & Communications authority |
| Project/master closeout decision | PMO / Engineering with independent PR Approver / Engineering verification |
| Project/master closeout transaction | Designated Administration & Communications role holder who did not solely implement the underlying child work |
| Program/umbrella closeout decision | Product Authority and PMO / Engineering under recorded program-closeout authority |
| Promotion Candidate Go/No-Go and closeout disposition | PMO / Engineering, PR Approver / Engineering, and other roles required by the approval profile |
| Production promotion and closeout disposition | Recorded Production authority plus required Engineering approval |
| Production incident classification, recovery strategy, and incident closeout decision | Day-2 Operations |
| Issue/PR/check/deployment state, communication, hold/resume administration, and recording of authorized closeout | Administration & Communications |
| Mechanically provable validation and bounded automation | Deterministic CI |

## Approval model

- Implementation / Operations does not approve its own protected work or Production promotion.
- Task closeout is an administrative completion action and does not substitute for PR approval, integration authority, Promotion Candidate qualification, or Production approval.
- Deterministic CI may record automated eligibility, integrate eligible non-main work, and execute authorized deterministic closeout; it does not impersonate human Engineering approval.
- PR Approver / Engineering handles subjective alignment, protected changes, Promotion Candidate qualification, and required Production review.
- Product Authority is not a routine gate during approved Development work; escalation occurs for product, priority, cost, business, credential, or protected Production decisions.
- Advisory collaboration is not formal approval. Formal PR review remains GitHub-native and must be performed by an authorized independent reviewer.

## Delegated task closeout

The assigned Implementation / Operations role holder is accountable for reaching a correct terminal state for an explicitly assigned project-child or child-remediation Issue when all of the following are true:

1. the Issue class and parent/master relationship are explicit;
2. required implementation and validation are complete;
3. required independent review or authorized integration has occurred;
4. post-integration verification passes;
5. successor and parent reporting disposition are determinable;
6. no protected stop, operational hold, or unresolved closeout exception remains; and
7. the closeout packet is complete.

Deterministic CI is the preferred transaction executor. When automation does not complete a mechanically eligible transaction, the assigned Implementation / Operations role holder may post the closeout packet, reconcile permitted task state, and close the assigned Issue under bounded delegated Administration & Communications authority.

This delegation does not authorize the assigned role holder to close a project/master, program/umbrella, Promotion Candidate, Production, release, incident, standalone `OPS:`, or Product Authority disposition Issue.

## Administration & Communications responsibilities

Administration & Communications follows all horizontal lanes and all work queues.

It may:

- route assignments, collaboration requests, evidence, decision requests, acknowledgments, and escalation;
- reconcile deterministic Issue, PR, team, priority, PMO, routing, check, deployment, incident, and closeout state;
- prepare Go/No-Go and Promotion Candidate evidence packets;
- apply, narrow, release, and restore recorded holds under the owning role's decision;
- resolve missing, partial, contradictory, or failed administrative transactions;
- maintain planned-versus-completed accounting;
- audit child-task closeout evidence during project/master closeout; and
- execute closeout transactions under the role-based executor matrix.

It must not independently change product outcome, design, acceptance, implementation scope, delivery model, promotion profile, PR disposition, recovery strategy, priority, queue ownership, or Production authority.

## Runner and controller responsibilities

The runner and routing controller are shared communications/control-plane infrastructure in Administration & Communications.

- They carry authorized events and deterministic actions.
- They do not own the meaning of the event.
- Implementation / Operations owns workflow creation and onboarding.
- Day-2 Operations owns runner host/service availability, security, capacity, stop/start, rollback, and recovery.
- The originating horizontal lane owns the action's decision authority.

## Universal collaboration boundary

Any source-Issue owner may request bounded collaboration from another agent without creating a new Issue or transferring ownership.

The collaborator:

- acknowledges on the same source Issue;
- reviews the referenced evidence;
- provides the bounded response;
- records completion;
- returns execution to the Issue owner.

The collaborator normally does not modify the branch or PR. A separately authorized implementation contribution, ownership handoff, or formal PR review is required before touching those surfaces.

## Lightweight problem adjustment

Any role may post `PROBLEM FOUND`.

The Issue routes to the role that made the controlling decision:

```text
PROBLEM FOUND
  -> GUIDANCE or ADJUSTMENT by owning role
  -> Administration & Communications records the decision
  -> RESUME
```

Only the affected scope pauses unless evidence requires broader impact. Use `PLAN CHANGE REQUIRED` only for material changes to product outcome, architecture, acceptance criteria, dependency structure, delivery model, Production boundary, or recovery strategy.

## Protected stop conditions

All roles stop the affected scope and route the Issue when any of the following is true:

1. unresolved material product, design, architecture, or acceptance decision;
2. conflicting canonical authority;
3. unsafe preview, Sandbox, component, or Production isolation;
4. missing credential, cost, business, privacy, legal, or destructive-action authority;
5. evidence that the approved design cannot satisfy acceptance without material change;
6. missing or contradictory source Issue, dependency, validation, approval, promotion-profile, safety, or closeout authority;
7. active numbered Operations interrupt covering the work;
8. attempted bypass of Sandbox -> Development -> Promotion Candidate -> Production progression;
9. contradictory team ownership or cross-namespace priority labels; or
10. attempted task closeout without required independent review, integration, post-integration verification, or deterministic terminal state.

Routine wording corrections, deterministic administrative reconciliation, bounded validation remediation, collaboration, and in-scope implementation adjustments are not protected stops.

## Operating modes

| Mode | Purpose | Typical role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design | Architecture, decomposition, acceptance framing | PMO / Engineering |
| Sandbox | Isolated proof-of-concept and factual design evidence | PMO / Engineering + Implementation / Operations |
| Documentation | Canonical Explanation, How-to, Reference, Tutorial, and governance alignment | PMO / Engineering or assigned Implementation / Operations |
| Governance | Authority, role, gate, and policy alignment | PMO / Engineering |
| Worklist | Program hierarchy and Issue structure | PMO / Engineering + Administration & Communications |
| Verification | PR, CI, Promotion Candidate, Production, and post-deployment validation | PR Approver / Engineering + Deterministic CI |
| Troubleshooting | Failed gates, broken workflows, inconsistent state | Owning horizontal lane with Administration & Communications routing |
| Implementation | Development and Promotion Candidate execution | Implementation / Operations |
| Administration & Communications | Evidence, routing, state, escalation, hold/resume, reporting, closeout | Administration & Communications + Deterministic CI + delegated role holders where policy permits |
| Day-2 Operations | Production monitoring, incident response, recovery | Day-2 Operations |

## End-to-end workflow

```text
Product Authority / PMO input
  -> Engineering Pipeline preparation and optional Sandbox
  -> Project Graduation and implementation Go
  -> PMO Active Development execution and automated PR gates
  -> independent review or authorized integration
  -> post-integration task verification and eligible child closeout
  -> Promotion Candidate qualification
  -> Production approval, deployment, and live verification
  -> Day-2 Operations monitoring and support
```

Numbered Operations work may interrupt Engineering preparation or PMO Active execution at the nearest safe checkpoint.

Administration & Communications supports every step vertically.

## Launch-control package

Before Development begins, the source authority includes:

- one primary source Issue;
- assigned role and current role holder;
- active lane and promotion profile;
- Issue class and parent/master relationship;
- task-closeout delegation state;
- documentation/design reference;
- exact file allowlist;
- scope and non-goals;
- acceptance criteria;
- dependency and protected-stop state;
- validation and rollback plan;
- implementation Go.

## Startup orientation

When Product Authority says `run startup`, the active product identifies itself and performs its own product-specific orientation-only startup, then stops — Product Authority does not need to say `run Work startup` or `run Claude Code startup`; see `docs/ops/ai/CORE-RULES.md`'s "PRODUCT STARTUP FRAMEWORK" for the shared skeleton and `docs/ops/ai/WORK-RULES.md`, `docs/ops/ai/CODEX-RULES.md`, and `docs/ops/ai/CLAUDE-CODE-RULES.md` for each product's contract. Startup does not authorize queue audit, implementation resume, GitHub mutation, or administrative reconciliation, regardless of product.

## Supersession

Legacy person-specific or agent-specific policy is superseded where it conflicts with this durable role model. Current team mappings belong here or in project manifests; runtime compatibility documents may describe how a current member exercises an assigned role but must not redefine repository-wide authority. Queue, priority, graduation, and collaboration details belong in `WORK-QUEUES-AND-COLLABORATION.md` rather than being redefined per agent.
