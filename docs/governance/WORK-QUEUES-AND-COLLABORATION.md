# Work Queues and Collaboration

## Purpose

This document defines how LGFC work is classified, prioritized, interrupted, prepared, executed, and collaboratively supported across the repository.

It establishes one Operations interrupt queue above two peer normal-work queues:

```text
Operations interrupt queue
        |
        +-- PMO Active implementation queue
        +-- Engineering Pipeline-preparation queue
```

Operations has precedence while numbered Operations work is actionable. PMO and Engineering are peer queues with mutually exclusive meanings and priority namespaces.

## Authority boundary

Product Authority and the weekly PMO meeting make final priority, launch, hold, reprioritization, graduation, and completion decisions.

This policy defines how those decisions are represented and executed. It does not make the decisions.

The detailed domain authorities remain:

- PMO portfolio and launch decisions: `docs/governance/PMO-PORTFOLIO.md`;
- team roles and approval authority: `docs/governance/AGENT-TEAM.md`;
- Operations recovery strategy: `docs/governance/OPERATIONS-AND-RECOVERY.md`;
- communication transport and reconciliation: `docs/governance/ADMINISTRATION-AND-COMMUNICATIONS.md`;
- pull-request process and formal review: `docs/governance/PR_PROCESS.md`.

## Work queues

### Operations

Operations is Day-2 support for a website or repository capability that is already in Production and has failed, degraded, become unsafe, or stopped meeting its accepted operating standard.

A qualifying standalone Operations Issue:

- is the authoritative source Issue for the operational problem;
- is not a child of a project master;
- interrupts new PMO implementation and Engineering preparation while it carries a numbered Operations priority;
- receives the next available capacity required for remediation;
- remains subject to scope, validation, independent review, Production authority, rollback, and recovery controls.

Cursor is the normal primary remediation implementer. ChatGPT may participate as Tier 2 Operations support when design, architecture, acceptance, recovery planning, or independent Engineering judgment is needed.

### PMO

PMO is the Active queue for launched projects being implemented, validated, promoted, deployed, verified, and closed.

PMO priority answers:

> In what order should launched projects receive focus and be completed?

The PMO meeting governs parent priority, project launch, project hold or reprioritization, Project Graduation, and project completion.

The project governs child-task sequence, dependencies, implementation order, and technical execution within approved authority.

### Engineering

Engineering is the Pipeline-preparation queue for projects that have not received implementation Go.

Engineering priority answers:

> In what order should Pipeline projects be designed, documented, packaged, and made ready for a future Go/No-Go decision?

ChatGPT / ChatGPT is the normal Engineering preparation owner. Cursor may collaborate for bounded repository inspection, feasibility evidence, validation design, or authorized Sandbox work. Collaboration does not authorize Active implementation.

## Exclusive queue ownership

A source Issue belongs to at most one work queue at a time:

- `team:operations`;
- `team:pmo`;
- `team:engineering`.

An Issue must never carry more than one `team:*` assignment.

Priority and state labels must match the assigned team. Cross-namespace combinations are prohibited because they create dual ownership and contradictory routing.

Examples of invalid state:

```text
team:engineering + pmo:priority:1
team:pmo + eng:priority:1
team:operations + team:pmo
ops:priority:2 + eng:priority:2
```

Collaboration labels or collaborator assignments do not change the queue owner.

## Queue labels and priority namespaces

### Operations labels

Operations source Issues use:

```text
team:operations
```

and exactly one Operations priority or non-blocking state:

```text
ops:priority:1
ops:priority:2
ops:priority:3
ops:priority:4
ops:monitoring
ops:hold
```

All numbered Operations priorities are actionable and interrupt PMO and Engineering work. The number orders multiple actionable Operations Issues.

`ops:monitoring` means remediation has progressed as far as currently possible and stability or recurrence must be observed on a recorded interval.

`ops:hold` means remediation cannot progress until specified information, authority, access, vendor action, external evidence, or another release condition is satisfied.

Monitoring and Hold do not block PMO or Engineering work. Each must record:

- reason;
- responsible owner;
- update interval or next-review time;
- evidence expected;
- condition for returning to a numbered priority or closing.

When a numbered Operations Issue has been worked as far as possible, it must move to Monitoring or Hold rather than remain falsely actionable.

### PMO labels

Active portfolio parents use:

```text
team:pmo
pmo:priority:1 | pmo:priority:2 | pmo:priority:3 | pmo:priority:4
```

PMO priority is defined only on the Active project or program parent. Child tasks do not receive PMO priority labels.

### Engineering labels

Pipeline portfolio parents and their peer Engineering preparation assignments use:

```text
team:engineering
eng:priority:1 | eng:priority:2 | eng:priority:3 | eng:priority:4 | eng:priority:idea
```

Engineering priority is not implementation authority and does not indicate actual readiness. Pipeline stage separately reports maturity.

## Active PMO priority model

| Priority | Execution meaning | Capacity | Promotion eligibility signal |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| P1 | Current team focus whenever executable work exists | Maximum 4 parent projects | Not applicable |
| P2 | Work when no executable P1 work exists | Maximum 4 parent projects | Eligible for P1 consideration at 80% complete |
| P3 | Work when no executable P1 or P2 work exists | Maximum 4 parent projects | Eligible for P2 consideration at 70% complete |
| P4 | Opportunistic work when higher-priority work is not executable | No fixed limit | Eligible for P3 consideration at 50% complete |

Rules:

- All priority changes are manual PMO meeting decisions.
- Percentage completion is completed linked tasks divided by total linked tasks.
- Thresholds signal eligibility only; they never change priority automatically.
- Eligibility may be stated in the parent description.
- Capacity limits apply to parent projects/programs, not child tasks.
- A project may complete and close at P2, P3, or P4.
- Lower-priority completion is valid use of otherwise idle execution capacity.
- Verification, promotion, deployment validation, and administrative closeout remain Active project work.
- Website delivery may be established as the top LGFC priority by the PMO meeting, but it is not permanently hard-coded as automatic P1 policy.

## Engineering Pipeline priority model

Pipeline priority controls preparation order, not implementation order.

| Engineering priority | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| P1 | Prepare this project for the next applicable PMO graduation review ahead of lower-priority Pipeline work |
| P2 | Next preparation wave after current P1 preparation needs |
| P3 | Future definition and planning work |
| P4 | Opportunistic or longer-range preparation |
| Idea | Retained for PMO awareness without numbered preparation priority |

Rules:

- Priority and Pipeline stage are independent.
- Any Pipeline project may move directly from P2, P3, P4, or Idea to Engineering P1.
- Engineering P1 may truthfully remain at Intake, Discovery, Definition, Planning, Preparation, or Ready for Launch.
- There is no time limit for a project to remain at any Engineering priority or Pipeline stage.
- Priority changes are manual PMO meeting decisions.
- Engineering P1 creates accountable preparation work; priority alone is not considered sufficient routing.

## Engineering preparation assignment

When the PMO meeting sets a Pipeline parent to Engineering P1, the same meeting closeout must create or reactivate one peer Engineering preparation Issue owned by ChatGPT / ChatGPT.

The preparation Issue:

- is peer to the Pipeline parent;
- references the parent with `Related Pipeline Project: #<number>` or `Graduation Target: #<number>`;
- must not use `Parent Project:`;
- must not use `pmo:task`;
- does not count toward implementation completion percentage;
- carries `team:engineering` and the applicable `eng:priority:*` label;
- has one bounded objective: prepare the project for Project Graduation review.

Required preparation outputs include, as applicable:

- reconciled objective, scope, and non-goals;
- requirements and acceptance criteria;
- architecture and design;
- repository authority and document disposition;
- dependency and collision analysis;
- implementation plan;
- master Issue refinement;
- ordered implementation child Issues;
- file scopes and validation requirements;
- risk, rollback, stop, and Production boundaries;
- execution-agent recommendation;
- launch-readiness assessment;
- Go, No-Go, Hold, or Adjustment recommendation.

There must be no more than one open Engineering preparation assignment for the same Pipeline parent.

## Project Graduation

Project Graduation is the explicit PMO transition from Pipeline/Engineering preparation into Active/PMO implementation.

Graduation requires:

1. a complete-enough launch package;
2. truthful `Ready for Launch` Pipeline stage;
3. PMO meeting review;
4. explicit Go;
5. assignment of an Active PMO priority;
6. recorded execution owner, first executable task, and implementation authority.

At graduation:

- remove the Pipeline lifecycle and stage representation;
- remove `team:engineering` and `eng:priority:*`;
- add the Active lifecycle representation;
- add `team:pmo` and the PMO-selected `pmo:priority:*`;
- preserve the prepared task sequence and dependencies.

Engineering priority never transfers automatically to PMO priority. Engineering P1 means prepare first; PMO P1 means execute and complete first.

## Child-task execution order

Child tasks are ordered according to project needs, not PMO or Engineering priority.

A child task should identify ordering through Issue-body metadata such as:

- Task ID;
- predecessor;
- successor;
- dependency;
- execution sequence.

Sequence labels may be introduced only when a separate implementation decision proves they improve deterministic routing. Team priority labels are prohibited on child tasks.

## Daily work precedence

### Cursor

1. Numbered Operations Issues.
2. Active PMO project tasks, selected by parent PMO priority and then project sequence.
3. Engineering collaboration only when explicitly requested and bounded.

Operations Monitoring and Hold Issues receive their required interval updates but do not block PMO work.

### ChatGPT

1. Numbered Operations Issues when assigned for Tier 2 support, Engineering judgment, review, or coordination.
2. PMO work when assigned for design adjustment, independent review, promotion, Production decision preparation, verification, or closeout.
3. Engineering Pipeline preparation, selected by Engineering priority.

## Universal collaboration method

Any agent working an authoritative source Issue may request bounded collaboration from another agent on that same Issue.

Collaboration does not:

- create a second source Issue;
- change team ownership;
- change priority namespace;
- replace the Issue owner;
- authorize implementation, approval, Production action, or Project Graduation beyond the collaborator's recorded role.

Use four universal events:

```text
COLLABORATION REQUEST
COLLABORATION ACKNOWLEDGED
COLLABORATION RESPONSE
COLLABORATION COMPLETE
```

### Collaboration request

A request identifies:

- source Issue;
- source team and current owner;
- requesting agent and role;
- target agent and role;
- exact bounded contribution;
- evidence and references;
- blocking scope;
- authority retained by the source owner or controlling role;
- acknowledgment requirement;
- completion condition.

### Acknowledgment

The target agent acknowledges on the same source Issue, states the accepted scope, and identifies any missing evidence.

### Response

The collaborator records evidence-specific analysis, guidance, validation, or recommendation on the same source Issue. Existing decision vocabulary may be used when applicable:

- `GUIDANCE`;
- `ADJUSTMENT`;
- `PROBLEM FOUND`;
- `PLAN CHANGE REQUIRED`;
- `HOLD`;
- `RESUME`.

### Completion

The collaborator records completion, the evidence reviewed, the bounded result, any remaining condition, and the next action returned to the Issue owner.

The Issue owner then resumes execution.

## Collaboration involving pull requests

The source Issue owns assignment, routing, authority, queue, and collaboration state.

The pull request owns the diff, checks, review threads, and technical evidence.

Normal collaboration involving a PR works as follows:

1. request collaboration on the source Issue and identify the PR and relevant head SHA;
2. collaborator reads the PR, diff, checks, or threads as necessary;
3. collaborator records the bounded response on the source Issue;
4. Issue owner applies the response and continues branch/PR work;
5. collaborator does not modify the PR or branch unless a separately authorized contribution or handoff exists.

Formal GitHub PR review is a separate exception. When policy requires independent review, the authorized reviewer must use GitHub-native review and thread surfaces. Advisory collaboration is not approval, and a formal review does not change source-Issue ownership.

A response tied to a PR or commit is valid only for the identified evidence. Materially changed evidence may require a new request or re-review.

## Peer and child relationships

These are peer source records:

- standalone Operations Issues;
- Active PMO project/program parents;
- Pipeline portfolio parents;
- Engineering preparation Issues.

Peer Issues reference one another with fields such as:

- Related Project;
- Related Pipeline Project;
- Graduation Target;
- Affected Production Feature;
- Source Operations Issue.

Only real project implementation tasks use `Parent Project:` and child-task classification.

## Weekly PMO meeting

The weekly PMO meeting between Bill and ChatGPT reviews:

- all PMO dashboard portfolio parents;
- Active priority and capacity;
- Engineering Pipeline priority and stage;
- new Engineering P1 preparation assignments;
- graduation candidates;
- Go, No-Go, Hold, Adjustment, reprioritization, and completion decisions;
- stale or contradictory portfolio metadata.

The meeting does not define individual child-task implementation order.

## Transition and implementation boundary

This policy defines the target authoritative model.

Live creation of the new labels, dashboard generator and validator support, queue-routing automation, and bulk Issue reconciliation require a separate implementation Issue and reviewed PR.

Until that implementation is complete:

- do not bulk relabel existing Issues;
- do not interpret transitional legacy labels as permission for dual ownership;
- use this policy for decision semantics and record intended target labels in the implementation package;
- retain current runtime-compatible metadata only as a temporary technical representation;
- resolve conflicts in favor of this policy and the Product Authority decision recorded in #2699.

## Supersession

This policy supersedes lower-level or legacy instructions that:

- treat Operations, PMO, and Engineering as peer queues;
- combine PMO Active priority with Pipeline preparation priority;
- require priority labels on child implementation tasks;
- allow one Issue to belong to multiple team-priority namespaces;
- treat Pipeline P1 as proof of launch readiness;
- allow a priority change without accountable preparation work;
- create a second Issue merely to enable agent collaboration;
- require collaborators to take over branch or PR work when bounded Issue-based guidance is sufficient;
- treat advisory collaboration as formal PR approval.
