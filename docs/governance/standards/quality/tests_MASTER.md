- Build must succeed.

## Required checks for UI/route changes
- Verify canonical routes still resolve.
- Verify auth redirects for `/fanclub/**`.
- Verify header/footer variants.

## Required checks for CI/governance changes
- Verify new rules trigger on a controlled test PR.
- Verify they do not block legitimate changes for the intended label.
