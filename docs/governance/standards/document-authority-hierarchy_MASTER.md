# Document Authority Hierarchy (_MASTER)

## Precedence Order
1. Governance
2. Standards
3. Operations As-Built (_MASTER)
4. Project Reference (_INCOMPLETE)
5. Project Intent (_DRAFT)

## Conflict Resolution
If documents disagree:
- Governance and _MASTER documents override all others.
- _INCOMPLETE and _DRAFT inform future direction but do not control production decisions.
