# Repository Authority

## Purpose

This document is the repository constitution for LGFC. It defines precedence, domain ownership, and the top-level operating topology so process changes update one owning domain instead of rewriting unrelated authority.

## Temporary constitutional adjustment register

Project [#2678](https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/issues/2678) is the temporary constitutional adjustment register while its approved governance refinements are being implemented.

All governance-sensitive agents must read both this constitution and Project #2678 during this transition. Approved constitutional adjustments recorded in #2678 temporarily supplement this constitution only for the specific subjects they address; they do not otherwise change the long-term authority model.

When Project #2678 is fully implemented and its approved changes are merged into the canonical governance documents, that same documentation change must remove this section and every other constitutional reference to #2678.

## Precedence

When sources conflict, resolve in this order:

1. Locked product decisions and explicit Product Authority decisions above the source Issue.
2. This constitution.
3. Domain policy documents named in the domain-ownership table.
4. Shared contracts and profiles under `docs/reference/**`.
5. Source GitHub Issue for the active task.
6. Procedures under `docs/how-to/**`.
7. Implementation and as-built state.
8. Issue comments, PR bodies, chat, external notifications, and agent memory.

GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are the authoritative execution record for normal repository work.

## GitHub Issue authority

- One open, same-repository, non-PR source Issue is task authority for implementation.
- The Issue body, allowlist, acceptance criteria, and recorded role authority define scope.
- Labels, comments, alerts, and runner events are routing and evidence surfaces; they do not replace task or approval authority.
- Tracker files are historical indexes unless a source Issue explicitly authorizes edits.

## Canonical-source rule

Each topic has one active canonical owner. Other documents may link to that owner but must not restate competing rules.

A normal PR that touches a legacy document must complete its disposition before the PR completes.

## Authority layers

| Layer | Purpose | Typical location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Constitution | Precedence, domain ownership, lane and queue topology, escalation | `docs/governance/REPOSITORY-AUTHORITY.md` |
| 1 — Domain policy | One policy boundary per domain | `docs/governance/**` |
| 2 — Shared contracts | Stable metadata, profiles, and classification | `docs/reference/**` |
| 3 — Procedures | Single execution paths | `docs/how-to/**` |
| 4 — Implementation | Workflows, scripts, templates, live configuration | `.github/**`, `scripts/**`, as-built documents |

## Operating lane topology

Three operating lanes run horizontally:

1. **PMO / Engineering**
2. **Implementation / Operations**
3. **Day-2 Operations**

One control lane runs vertically across all three:

4. **Administration & Communications**

```text
                    Administration & Communications
                    evidence | routing | runner | state
                         |             |             |
                         v             v             v
PMO / Engineering -> Implementation / Operations -> Day-2 Operations
```

The horizontal lanes make decisions within their authority. Administration & Communications records, routes, acknowledges, escalates, and executes authorized state transitions.

The repository runner and routing controller are communications/control-plane infrastructure in the vertical lane. Their host/service health remains a Day-2 Operations responsibility.

## Work-queue topology

Lanes define durable authority and responsibility. Work queues define which authorized work receives attention first.

```text
Operations interrupt queue
        |
        +-- PMO Active implementation queue
        +-- Engineering Pipeline-preparation queue
```

Constitutional queue invariants:

1. Numbered Operations work has interrupt precedence over PMO and Engineering work.
2. PMO Active implementation and Engineering Pipeline preparation are peer normal-work queues.
3. A source Issue belongs to at most one team queue at a time.
4. Team-priority namespaces are mutually exclusive.
5. Operations Monitoring and Hold are non-blocking states subject to recorded interval review.
6. Project child tasks do not receive team-level priority; the parent priority selects the project and the project sequence selects the task.
7. Pipeline-to-Active movement requires explicit Project Graduation and a newly assigned Active priority.
8. Collaboration may add participants but never creates dual queue ownership.

Detailed queue, priority, graduation, and collaboration rules live in `docs/governance/WORK-QUEUES-AND-COLLABORATION.md`.

## Promotion-profile authority

The canonical promotion sequence is:

```text
Sandbox -> Development -> Promotion Candidate -> Production -> Day-2 Operations
```

- Sandbox is optional PMO / Engineering proof-of-concept work.
- Development and Promotion Candidate are technical profiles inside the conversational Implementation / Operations lane.
- Promotion Candidate is the mandatory barrier before Production.
- Sandbox cannot move directly to Promotion Candidate or Production.
- Development cannot move directly to Production.

Canonical definitions live in `docs/reference/operations/operating-lanes-and-promotion-profiles.md`. Delivery policy lives in `docs/governance/DELIVERY-AND-RELEASE.md`.

## Domain ownership

Each domain has exactly one canonical policy file.

| Domain | Canonical policy owner | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product and Design | `docs/governance/PRODUCT-AND-DESIGN.md` | Product behavior, UX, functional requirements |
| PMO and Portfolio | `docs/governance/PMO-PORTFOLIO.md` | Intake, sizing, priority decisions, launch authorization, PMO / Engineering boundaries |
| Work Queues and Collaboration | `docs/governance/WORK-QUEUES-AND-COLLABORATION.md` | Queue classification and precedence, team/priority namespaces, Active and Pipeline priority semantics, Project Graduation, universal collaboration |
| Delivery and Release | `docs/governance/DELIVERY-AND-RELEASE.md` | Delivery models, four promotion profiles, integration, approval, rollback, promotion |
| Agent Team | `docs/governance/AGENT-TEAM.md` | Durable roles, current member mapping, approval and protected-stop policy |
| CI and Verification | `docs/governance/CI-AND-VERIFICATION.md` | Check classification, deterministic evidence, promotion criteria, failure routing, post-merge verification |
| Administration and Communications | `docs/governance/ADMINISTRATION-AND-COMMUNICATIONS.md` | Cross-lane communication, routing, runner/control-plane placement, evidence, hold/resume, reporting, closeout |
| Operations and Recovery | `docs/governance/OPERATIONS-AND-RECOVERY.md` | Production health, incidents, containment, recovery strategy, operational hold release |
| Documentation and Knowledge | `docs/governance/standards/DIATAXIS-FOLDER-AUTHORITY.md` | DIATAXIS routing, migration ratchet, archive rules |
| Platform and Environment | `docs/governance/PLATFORM-AND-ENVIRONMENT.md` | Cloudflare, D1, B2, environment boundaries, bindings, credentials, migrations, rollback |

All policy paths named in this table are active canonical owners. Introducing a new domain or replacing an owner requires an approved constitutional update and complete disposition of the prior owner.

## Supporting references

Supporting references inform a domain but do not share policy ownership.

| Topic | Supporting reference |
| --- | --- |
| Lane and profile contract | `docs/reference/operations/operating-lanes-and-promotion-profiles.md` |
| Work queue and collaboration contract | `docs/reference/operations/work-queue-and-collaboration-contract.md` |
| Administration mutation contract | `docs/reference/operations/administrative-control-lane-contract.md` |
| Runner contract | `docs/reference/ci/repository-runner-contract.md` |
| Product design standards | `docs/reference/design/LGFC-Production-Design-and-Standards.md` |
| Documentation architecture | `docs/governance/DOCUMENT-ARCHITECTURE.md` |

## Role-based authority

Broad policy assigns authority to durable roles, not person or product names. Current mappings belong in `docs/governance/AGENT-TEAM.md` or a project manifest.

Required durable roles include:

- Product Authority;
- PMO / Engineering;
- Implementation / Operations;
- PR Approver / Engineering;
- Administration & Communications;
- Day-2 Operations;
- Deterministic CI.

## Lightweight problem adjustment

Any role may report `PROBLEM FOUND`.

The issue routes to the role that made the controlling decision. That role records `GUIDANCE` or `ADJUSTMENT`; Administration & Communications records the state and routes `RESUME`.

Only material changes to product outcome, architecture, acceptance criteria, dependency structure, delivery model, production boundary, or recovery strategy require formal plan revision.

## Agent material routing

| Material | Canonical location |
| --- | --- |
| Binding agent policy | `docs/governance/**` |
| Agent facts and contracts | `docs/reference/**` |
| Agent execution procedures | `docs/how-to/**` |
| Live queues, handoffs, runtime routing state | `docs/ops/**` |

Files under `docs/ops/ai/` that currently hold binding policy remain authoritative until migrated through an explicit source Issue. Do not create new binding policy there.

## Supersession

A document supersedes another only when disposition is complete: correct folder, authority header, ownership boundary, non-conflict with higher authority, and merge to the active branch or approved Model B component branch.

## Escalation

Escalate to the recorded controlling role when:

- canonical documents make an irreconcilable authority decision;
- a material product, design, production, or recovery decision is unresolved;
- preview/production isolation cannot be established safely;
- an action would bypass a mandatory promotion profile or protected boundary.

Routine document migration, header correction, reference updates, deterministic Administration reconciliation, and duplicate cleanup are not escalation events.
