   - Loads from CDN
   - Consider async loading for better LCP

2. **Cloudflare Caching:**
   - Configure cache rules (documented)
   - Expected cache hit rate: >90% for static assets
   - TTL: 1 month recommended

3. **Images:**
   - Consider Next.js Image component for future image additions
   - Optimize favicon if larger versions added

## Accessibility Compliance

âœ… Semantic HTML used throughout
