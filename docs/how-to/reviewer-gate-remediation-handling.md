# How-To — Handle Governance Remediation PRs Safely

## Goal
Prevent reviewer workflow deadlocks during governance or CI remediation work.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Classify the PR
Confirm the PR is remediation-focused.

### Step 2 — Verify Narrow Scope
Confirm the PR only changes governance, CI, workflow, or reconciliation files.

### Step 3 — Downgrade Advisory Reviewers
Reviewer advisory workflows should remain informational and non-blocking.

### Step 4 — Preserve Merge Safety
Required approvals and protected review enforcement remain active.

### Step 5 — Validate Governance Integrity
Confirm issue mapping and allowlist behavior remain valid.

## Expected Result
Governance repair PRs remain mergeable while repository safety remains enforced.
