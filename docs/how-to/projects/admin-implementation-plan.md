# Admin Implementation Plan

## Objective

Deliver the Admin ecosystem in controlled phases without crossing Fan Club, public-site, or governance boundaries.

## Execution

Implement this plan as serial, reviewable units. Each phase should produce a focused implementation issue or PR with acceptance criteria, verification notes, and no redesign of production authority.

## Phase 1 — Admin foundation

Tasks:

- Complete dashboard entry surface.
- Complete system-health surface.
- Verify admin navigation.
- Verify audit logging expectations.

Acceptance criteria:

- `/admin/**` routes used for admin work.
- Admin is not exposed in public footer or mobile hamburger navigation.
- Sensitive operations use the documented admin security boundary.

## Phase 2 — Managed content areas

Tasks:

- Media management.
- Milestone management.
- Event management.
- Weekly matchup management.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each area has list, detail, create/edit, publish or activation states where applicable.
- High-impact actions produce audit records.

## Phase 3 — Review and oversight

Tasks:

- Moderation queue.
- Content review lifecycle.
- Member/user oversight lifecycle.

Acceptance criteria:

- Objective triage remains separate from human editorial decisions.
- Member data exposure is limited to operational need.

## Phase 4 — Reporting and operations

Tasks:

- Admin reporting.
- Operational metrics.
- Health summary refinement.

Acceptance criteria:

- Admin can understand production readiness and content state without direct database access.

## Child issue generation

Generate implementation issues by phase and entity area. No child issue may redefine security boundaries, navigation rules, or production authority.
