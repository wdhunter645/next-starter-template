# Admin CMS and Page Content

## Purpose

List, edit, save, and publish CMS blocks and page content (`#1121` / T43).

## Scope

Routes:

- `/admin/cms` — reusable CMS blocks
- `/admin/content` — page content records

APIs: `functions/api/admin/cms/**`, `functions/api/admin/content/**`.

## Steps

1. Sign in as admin and save the admin API token.
2. Open **CMS Blocks** or **Page Content**.
3. Load the list; select the target record.
4. Edit fields; save draft changes.
5. Publish when content is approved for public surfaces.

## Procedure

### CMS blocks

1. Open **CMS Blocks**.
2. Refresh the block list.
3. Edit block JSON or structured fields per page guidance.
4. Save; confirm success status.
5. Publish when ready for public consumption.

### Page content

1. Open **Page Content**.
2. Load records for the target public route or slug.
3. Edit title/body/metadata fields exposed by the editor.
4. Save draft; publish through the publish control when approved.
5. Verify public page separately (static export may require deploy).

### Boundaries with editorial inventory

`content_inventory` editorial workflows are owned by Program `#1256`. Use
[Editorial archive operations](./admin-editorial-archive-operations.md) for
inventory records; use this runbook for CMS blocks and page content tables.

## Verification

- `tests/admin-cms-content.test.tsx`
- Manual: list/save/publish fail closed without token.

## Closeout Criteria

CMS/content change is complete when save or publish succeeds and public eligibility
is confirmed per editorial policy.
