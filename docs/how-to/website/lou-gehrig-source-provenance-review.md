# Lou Gehrig Source Provenance Review

## Purpose

Every Lou Gehrig content candidate must be reviewed for provenance, rights,
credit, factual accuracy, and privacy before it becomes public-copy material.

## Review decision

Every candidate must be reviewed before it becomes public-copy material.

## Provenance checks

- Can the source be identified?
- Is the owner/publisher known?
- Is the citation sufficient for a future reviewer?
- Is the content traceable without relying on AI output?
- Is the source likely durable enough to cite?

## Rights and credit checks

- Is the material owned by LGFC?
- Is it public-domain-candidate only, or confirmed public domain?
- Is permission required?
- Is permission granted and documented?
- Is the content safer as link-only/reference-only?
- What credit line is required?

## Factual checks

- Is the fact supported by a reliable source?
- Does another reliable source corroborate it?
- Is the item interpretive rather than factual?
- Is uncertainty stated clearly?

## Privacy checks

- Does the content name or show living people?
- Does it involve donors, members, minors, or private submissions?
- Does it require consent or redaction?

## Review states

| Status | Meaning | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `candidate` | New lead | Begin provenance checks |
| `needs-source` | Source incomplete | Return to intake |
| `needs-rights-review` | Rights unresolved | Complete rights section below |
| `approved-for-reference` | Internal use only | Archive or cite internally |
| `approved-for-public-copy` | May draft website copy | Proceed to editorial conversion |
| `rejected` | Must not use | Record `rejection_reason` |
| `deferred` | Not current work | Re-queue later |

## Required rejection reasons

When rejecting, select or document one or more:

- untraceable source;
- disallowed source category;
- copyright/rights risk unacceptable;
- privacy risk unmitigable;
- duplicate without new value;
- unsupported factual claim;
- institution denied reproduction;
- operator discretion (document in notes).

## Credit-line rules

- Every approved item must have a `credit_line` before public-copy promotion.
- Link-only items credit the source URL and owner.
- LGFC-owned items credit LGFC with acquisition note.
- Permission-granted items credit per license terms.

## Fact-check confidence rules

| Level | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| high | Primary or multiple corroborating reputable sources |
| medium | Single reputable secondary source |
| low | Conflicting sources, interpretive content, or single weak source |

Low factual confidence blocks `approved-for-public-copy` unless Bill/Atlas approves with stated uncertainty.

## AI-assistance boundary

AI may summarize or extract metadata for operator review. AI output is not
source authority. Facts require primary or secondary source verification by a
human reviewer.

## Escalation path

If rights, factual confidence, or privacy is unclear:

1. Set status to `needs-rights-review`, `needs-source`, or `deferred`.
2. Document escalation reason in notes.
3. Notify Bill/Atlas for launch-critical or high-risk items.
4. Do not publish.
