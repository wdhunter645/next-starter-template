# Configure the LGFC Chromebook Repository Runner

## Prerequisite

Do not begin host registration until the repository runner contract and manual health workflow are present on `main`.

Confirm the Chromebook Linux environment is Debian 12 x64, systemd is available, outbound HTTPS works, and the Linux environment is dedicated to runner work while the service is active.

## Procedure

### Create the repository runner

In `wdhunter645/next-starter-template`:

1. Open **Settings → Actions → Runners**.
2. Select **New self-hosted runner**.
3. Select **Linux** and **x64**.
4. Keep the generated registration page open. The registration token is time-limited.

Use a repository-level runner.

### Install on Chromebook Linux

Use the exact runner version, download command, and checksum shown by GitHub.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/actions-runner"
cd "$HOME/actions-runner"
```

After downloading and extracting the runner package, register it with the generated token:

```bash
./config.sh \
  --url https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template \
  --token <REGISTRATION_TOKEN> \
  --name lgfc-chromebook-linux \
  --labels lgfc-repo-runner,chromebook,debian-12 \
  --work _work \
  --unattended
```

Do not store the registration token in repository files or reusable scripts.

### Install the service

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh install "$USER"
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

On Debian with `needrestart` enabled:

```bash
echo '$nrconf{override_rc}{qr(^actions\.runner\..+\.service$)} = 0;' \
  | sudo tee /etc/needrestart/conf.d/actions_runner_services.conf
```

### Verify registration

In **Settings → Actions → Runners**, confirm:

- runner name: `lgfc-chromebook-linux`;
- status: **Idle**;
- platform: Linux x64;
- labels include `lgfc-repo-runner`, `chromebook`, and `debian-12`.

### Run the health workflow

1. Open **Actions → Repository Runner Health**.
2. Select branch `main`.
3. Enter `RUNNER_HEALTH`.
4. Run the workflow.
5. Review the host capability and contract-validation summary.

The bootstrap workflow must remain manual-only and read-only. Do not migrate existing workflows to this runner during registration.

## Stop or remove

```bash
cd "$HOME/actions-runner"
sudo ./svc.sh stop
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

To remove the service:

```bash
sudo ./svc.sh uninstall
```

Remove the runner from repository settings before deleting the local installation directory.

## Troubleshooting

If a job remains queued, verify the service is running, the runner is **Idle**, the labels match, the workflow was dispatched from `main`, and the confirmation value is exact.

If any unexpected workflow is routed to the Chromebook, stop the service and disable the runner in repository settings before investigating.
