# Open a Task PR

## Preconditions

- Atlas or Bill approved PR creation, or Bill/Atlas provided an explicit PR-opening
  instruction or approved PR template.
- Local diff matches the reviewed packet (when a packet was required).
- Changed files are inside the source issue allowlist.
- Validation results are ready for PR body disclosure.
- Cursor will not merge, close issues, or mutate issue state when opening the PR.

## Steps

1. Confirm the source issue number and file-touch allowlist match the local diff.
2. Prepare the PR body from `/.github/pull_request_template.md`.
3. Include all mandatory governance fields listed under **PR Body Requirements**.
4. Allow the intent labeler to apply the repo-canonical intent for the changed
   paths (for example `docs-only` when all files are under `docs/**`).
5. Open the PR unassigned when authorized; do not merge.
6. Report PR number, branch, head SHA, changed files, validation, and disclosures.

## PR Body Requirements

The PR body must explicitly include:

- **Source issue line** — for example `- **Issue:** #NNNN`
- **Documentation source classification** — one of:
  - `DIATAXIS_FULL`
  - `DIATAXIS_ROUTED`
  - `LEGACY_FALLBACK`
- **Design source of truth** — canonical document path(s) used for the change
- **File-touch allowlist** — exact paths expected in the diff
- **Intent label** — the single intent label matching changed paths; for docs-only
  PRs under `docs/**`, use `docs-only` (do not force `change-ops` for PMO semantics)
- **Change summary** — what changed and why
- **Build/test/verification** — commands run and results
- **Documentation updates** — which docs changed and any tracker updates
- **Acceptance criteria** — checklist mapped to the source issue
- **Required pre-review self-check** — confirm allowlist, headers, and gates
- **Scope disclosures** — docs-only, no workflow/runtime changes, known out-of-scope
  validation failures, etc.
- **Post-merge issue disposition** — when applicable: comment-only, close after
  merge, or defer to Atlas; state that GitHub issue closeout occurs after merge
  unless specifically authorized
- **Queue / dependency-map status** (launched-program queue tasks) —
  dependency-map result (`pass` / `fail` / `not-applicable`), next queue item,
  and continue/halt decision; use `not-applicable` for one-off tasks or
  programs without an approved dependency map

## Validation

Before opening the PR, run the validation commands named in the source issue. When
repo-wide checks fail only on known pre-existing out-of-scope files, disclose that
in the PR body without fixing unrelated paths.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report instead of opening a PR when:

- no primary source issue exists or more than one source issue is claimed;
- changed files fall outside the allowlist;
- mandatory governance fields cannot be completed honestly;
- validation fails on a touched file;
- issue closure or relabeling is required before merge;
- Atlas has not reviewed the packet and Bill/Atlas has not authorized direct PR
  creation.
