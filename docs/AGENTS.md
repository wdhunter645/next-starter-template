The ChatGPT sandbox is running a cloned copy of the repository. 
To properly support this repository DO NOT use ChatGPT sandbox. 
Instead create a branch off the repository directly and create a pull request for all work so we can avoid the problems related solely to the GPT Sandbox and get actual work done within the repository.

This is the repository you are supporting. https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template
