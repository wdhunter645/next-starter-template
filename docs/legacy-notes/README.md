# Legacy Notes

This folder contains historical deployment logs, CI/CD investigations, and one-off markdown build notes.
These are retained for reference but are not part of the core documentation.

## Contents

- **ARCHIVE.md** - Documentation archive tracking files that have been removed or consolidated
- **PR_PATH_CHECKLIST.md** - One-off PR path verification log

## Purpose

These files are kept for historical reference and context but should not be considered part of the active documentation. For current documentation, see:

- [START_HERE.md](../START_HERE.md) - Getting started guide
- [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Deployment setup and configuration
- [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - Common issues and solutions
