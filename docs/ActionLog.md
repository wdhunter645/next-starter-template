# Action Log (Append-only)

Purpose: a lightweight, append-only record of completed work so we can quickly answer “what changed” without rereading threads.

Rules:
- Append only (do not rewrite history).
- One line per change set.
- Use PR numbers when available.

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | PR / Commit | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-01-26 | ZIP3 (pending PR) | Add Next.js dev-proxy for `/api/login`; mark ProjectPlan section 1 complete. |
