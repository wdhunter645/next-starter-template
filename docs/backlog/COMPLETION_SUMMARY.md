## üîú What Needs to Be Done Next

The following steps require GitHub web UI access or authenticated gh CLI:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issues

**Option A: Use the automated script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Requires gh CLI to be authenticated
./create-backlog-issues.sh
```

**Option B: Manual creation via gh CLI**
```bash
# Create parent issue
gh issue create --title "Operational Backlog from After-Action Reports" \
  --body-file docs/backlog/PARENT_ISSUE.md \
  --label "ops,backlog,automation"

# Then create 8 sub-issues (script does this automatically)
```

**Option C: Manual creation via GitHub web UI**
1. Go to https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/issues/new
2. Copy content from `docs/backlog/PARENT_ISSUE.md`
3. Add labels: ops, backlog, automation
4. Repeat for each sub-issue

### Step 2: Link PR #79 to Parent Issue

After parent issue is created (let's say it's #80):

**Update PR #79 description:**
- Add: `Closes #80` or `Part of #80`
- Include checklist of all 8 sub-issues

**Example:**
```markdown
## Related Issues

Closes #80 - Operational Backlog from After-Action Reports

### Sub-Issues
- [ ] #81 - Consolidate duplicate documentation
- [ ] #82 - Archive after-action reports
- [ ] #83 - Rotate exposed secrets ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
... (etc)
```

### Step 3: Update Sub-Issue Placeholders

Each sub-issue file contains `#[PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER]` placeholder.
The script automatically replaces this, or you can do it manually:

```bash
# If doing manually, replace before creating issues
sed -i 's/#\[PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER\]/#80/g' docs/backlog/SUB_ISSUE_*.md
```

### Step 4: Post Status Comment

After all issues are created, post the status comment on the parent issue.

Template is in `docs/backlog/README.md` under "Status Comment Template".

Replace all `#[N]` placeholders with actual issue numbers.

## üìã Quick Start Guide

For the repository owner or anyone with write access:

1. **Authenticate gh CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Run the automation script:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/runner/work/next-starter-template/next-starter-template
   ./create-backlog-issues.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the script output:**
   - Note the parent issue number
   - Note each sub-issue number
   - Script will output what to do next

4. **Complete the linking:**
   - Update PR #79 description with issue numbers
   - Post status comment on parent issue

## üéØ Success Criteria

This PR is complete when:
- [ ] Parent issue created with labels
- [ ] 8 sub-issues created with labels
- [ ] All sub-issues reference parent issue
- [ ] PR #79 description includes issue checklist
- [ ] PR #79 linked to parent issue
- [ ] Status comment posted on parent issue

## üìö Documentation References

- **Overview:** `docs/backlog/README.md`
- **Setup Guide:** `docs/backlog/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **Parent Issue:** `docs/backlog/PARENT_ISSUE.md`
- **Sub-Issues:** `docs/backlog/SUB_ISSUE_*.md`
- **Script:** `create-backlog-issues.sh`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Issue #3 is CRITICAL:** Rotate exposed secrets ASAP
2. **Script requires authentication:** gh CLI must be logged in
3. **Placeholders:** All `#[N]` must be replaced with real issue numbers
4. **Testing:** Script has been created but not executed (requires auth)

## üîç Verification

After completing all steps, verify:
```bash
# Check that issues were created
gh issue list --label "ops" --limit 10

# Check that parent issue exists
gh issue view [PARENT_NUMBER]

# Check a sub-issue
gh issue view [SUB_NUMBER]
```
