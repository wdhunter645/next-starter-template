# Sub-Issue #2: Archive Completed After-Action Reports

**Title:** Archive after-action reports to declutter root directory

**Labels:** `cleanup`, `ops`, `documentation`

**Parent Issue:** #[PARENT_ISSUE_NUMBER]

## Problem Statement

The repository root directory contains 10+ after-action report files documenting completed work. While valuable for historical context, they clutter the root directory and make it harder to find active documentation.

**Current state:**
```
/ (root)
├── DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md
├── DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md
├── DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md
├── IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
├── ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md
├── ISSUE_31_COMPLETE.md
├── ISSUE_34_COMPLETE.md
├── OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
├── QUICK_FIX_OAUTH.md
├── SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md
├── ... (other files)
```

**Issues:**
- Root directory cluttered with historical reports
- Hard to distinguish active docs from completed work
- No clear archive structure
- Reports may contain outdated information

## Definition of Done

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All after-action reports moved to organized archive structure
2. Archive organized by date (YYYY-MM format)
3. Root directory contains only active documentation
4. Archive index created listing all reports
5. Links to reports updated (if any external references)
6. Git history preserved (use `git mv` not delete/create)

### Target Structure

```
docs/
├── reports/
│   ├── 2025-10/
│   │   ├── DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md
│   │   ├── DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md

│   │   ├── OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
│   │   ├── QUICK_FIX_OAUTH.md
│   │   └── SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md
│   └── INDEX.md
```

## Risks & Assumptions

**Risks:**
- External documentation may link to root-level reports
- Git blame/history connections might be less obvious
- Users may look for reports in root first

**Assumptions:**
- Reports are primarily for internal reference
- Few (if any) external links to these specific files
- Most reports older than 1-2 weeks can be archived

**Mitigations:**
- Use `git mv` to preserve history
- Create INDEX.md explaining archive structure
- Add notice in root README about archived reports
- Check for and update any internal links

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Create docs/reports/ directory structure
- [ ] Create docs/reports/2025-10/ subdirectory
- [ ] Move all 10 report files using `git mv`
- [ ] Create docs/reports/INDEX.md with report listing
- [ ] Update README.md with note about archived reports
- [ ] Search for and update any internal links to moved files
- [ ] Verify git history preserved for moved files
- [ ] Clean build with new structure

## A→G Acceptance Loop

### A) Preconditions Verified
- [ ] All report files to be moved are identified and listed
- [ ] No active PRs or branches reference these files in their current location
- [ ] Write access to repository confirmed
- [ ] Git status clean (no uncommitted changes)

### B) Implementation Steps Executed
- [ ] Created docs/reports/2025-10/ directory
- [ ] Used `git mv` for all 10 files (preserves history)
- [ ] Created INDEX.md with report summaries
- [ ] Updated any cross-references
- [ ] Verified all files moved successfully

### C) Repo Health Checks Pass
- [ ] `npm run lint` - No errors
- [ ] `npm run build` - Successful build
- [ ] Git status shows moves (not deletes + adds)
- [ ] No broken links in documentation

### D) Minimal E2E Verification
**Exact commands/URLs:**
```bash
# Verify archive structure created
ls -la docs/reports/2025-10/
ls -la docs/reports/INDEX.md

# Verify files moved (not copied)
ls DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md  # Should not exist
ls docs/reports/2025-10/DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md  # Should exist

# Verify git history preserved
git log --follow docs/reports/2025-10/DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md

# Check for any remaining report files in root
ls -1 *.md | grep -i "complete\|report\|summary\|fix"

# Verify links in documentation
grep -r "DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE" docs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**Manual verification:**
- [ ] Root directory no longer contains report files
- [ ] docs/reports/2025-10/ contains all 10 files
- [ ] INDEX.md provides clear summary
- [ ] Git log shows file was moved (not deleted/recreated)

### E) Artifacts Updated
- [ ] docs/reports/2025-10/*.md (10 files moved)
- [ ] docs/reports/INDEX.md (created)
- [ ] README.md (add note about archived reports if needed)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md entry: "chore: archive after-action reports to docs/reports/"

### F) Link PR(s) and Reference Parent
- [ ] PR created with title: "chore: archive after-action reports"
- [ ] PR description: "Closes #[THIS_ISSUE], part of #[PARENT_ISSUE]"
- [ ] PR shows file moves (not deletes + adds)
- [ ] Labels: `cleanup`, `ops`

### G) Close with Post-Implementation Note

**Template:**
```markdown
## ✅ Completed

**What changed:**
- Moved 10 after-action reports from root to docs/reports/2025-10/
- Created INDEX.md catalog of all archived reports
- Root directory now contains only active documentation

**Files moved:**
- DEVCONTAINER_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md
- DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md
- DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
- ISSUES_COMPLETE_REPORT.md
- ISSUE_31_COMPLETE.md
- ISSUE_34_COMPLETE.md
- OAUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- QUICK_FIX_OAUTH.md
- SOLUTION_DELIVERED.md

**New location:** `docs/reports/2025-10/`

**Git history:** Preserved using `git mv` (not delete + create)

**Rollback:**
If needed, restore files to root:
```bash
cd docs/reports/2025-10
git mv *.md /home/runner/work/next-starter-template/next-starter-template/
cd /home/runner/work/next-starter-template/next-starter-template
git commit -m "Rollback: restore reports to root"
```

**Verification:**
- `ls *.md` in root shows no report files ✓
- `ls docs/reports/2025-10/` shows all 10 files ✓
- `git log --follow` shows file history preserved ✓
```
