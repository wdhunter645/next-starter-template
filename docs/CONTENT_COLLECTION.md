# Content Collection — Lou Gehrig Launch Pack

## Purpose

This document is the **central content inventory** for Day 1 launch.
It consolidates Gehrig-related research and draft copy into one place so every Day 1 page can be populated without last-minute scrambling.

This is not marketing fluff. It is operational content inventory: reusable, deduplicated, and structured.

## Sources Consolidated

- `docs/lou-gehrig-deep-research.md` (primary research pack)
- Existing page copy and snippets in the repository
- Any verified historical notes already captured in repo docs

## How This Document Is Used

- Page authors pull from the sections below to populate Day 1 pages.
- Copy is edited for tone, length, and placement, but source facts must remain accurate.
- When a section is used on a page, note the page(s) in that section for traceability.
