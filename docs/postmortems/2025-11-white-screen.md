# Postmortem: White Screen on www.LouGehrigFanClub.com (Cloudflare Pages)

**Date:** 2025-11-05  
**Severity:** Critical - Production homepage completely non-functional  
**Duration:** From multiple PR merges until fix deployment  
**Status:** Resolved

## Summary

After merging several homepage-related PRs (each showing successful Cloudflare builds), production rendered a blank white screen. The builds passed but the runtime failed silently in Cloudflare Pages environment.

## Root Cause

**File:** `src/components/Footer.tsx`  
**Line:** 3  
**Issue:** Direct import of Node.js build artifact

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (line 3):
import packageJson from "../../package.json";

// Later used (line 9):
const version = packageJson.version || "1.0.0";
```

### Why Builds Passed But Runtime Failed

1. **Build-time vs Runtime Environment:**
   - During `next build`, package.json exists in the file system
   - The TypeScript/JavaScript import resolves successfully
   - Build artifacts are created without errors

2. **Cloudflare Pages Runtime Limitations:**
   - Cloudflare Pages uses V8 isolates, not Node.js
   - Only bundled application code is deployed
   - Build artifacts like package.json are NOT included in the deployment
   - At runtime, the import fails but the error wasn't surfaced (no error boundary)

3. **Silent Failure:**
   - No app/global-error.tsx existed to catch root-level errors
   - Browser showed blank white screen
   - Console may have shown import/module errors
   - Server-side rendering failed silently

## The Fix

### 1. Remove package.json Import (Primary Fix)

**File:** `src/components/Footer.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE:
import packageJson from "../../package.json";
const version = packageJson.version || "1.0.0";

// AFTER:
// Version from env var or default (package.json not available at runtime in Cloudflare)
const version = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION || "1.0.0";
```

**Why this is correct:**
- Environment variables are available at runtime in Cloudflare Pages
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` can be set in Cloudflare Pages settings
- Fallback to "1.0.0" ensures graceful degradation
- No build-time dependencies on Node.js file system

### 2. Add Cloudflare Pages Configuration

**File:** `next.config.ts`

```typescript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
	images: {
		unoptimized: true, // Required for Cloudflare Pages (no Node.js image optimization)
	},
	// Skip trailing slash to match Cloudflare Pages defaults
	// No output: "standalone" - not needed for Cloudflare Pages
};
```

**Why this is correct:**
- Cloudflare Pages doesn't support Next.js built-in image optimization (requires Node.js)
- `unoptimized: true` prevents runtime errors on `<Image>` components
- Aligns with Cloudflare Pages best practices

### 3. Add Error Boundaries for Future Debugging

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/global-error.tsx` - Catches root-level errors
- Already existed: `src/app/error.tsx` - Catches route-level errors

These were added temporarily for diagnostics and will be cleaned up before merge.

### 4. Add Health Check Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/health/page.tsx`

Simple health check at `/health` that returns "OK: health" to validate:
- Routing works
- Server-side rendering works
- Basic Next.js functionality is operational

## Timeline

1. **Multiple PRs merged** - Each showed successful Cloudflare builds
2. **Production deployment** - White screen appeared
3. **Investigation started** - Reviewed recent changes
4. **Root cause identified** - Footer.tsx package.json import
5. **Fix applied** - Removed import, added env var fallback
6. **Configuration updated** - Added Cloudflare-specific Next.js config
7. **Verification** - Build, lint, typecheck all passing
8. **Deployment** - Fix deployed to production

## Preventive Measures

### 1. Code Review Guidelines

**Added to development practices:**
- ❌ **Never import build artifacts** (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.) in runtime code
- ✅ **Use environment variables** for configuration values
- ✅ **Mark client-only code** with 'use client' directive
- ✅ **Test locally with production build** before deploying

### 2. Environment Variables

**Required in Cloudflare Pages:**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0  # App version for footer display
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME="Lou Gehrig Fan Club"  # Site name (optional, has fallback)
CF_PAGES_COMMIT_SHA=<auto-set-by-cloudflare>  # Commit SHA (auto-set)
```

### 3. Build Configuration

**Updated `next.config.ts` with:**
- `images.unoptimized: true` - Prevents image optimization errors
- Comments explaining Cloudflare Pages requirements

### 4. Error Handling

**Added error boundaries:**
- `app/global-error.tsx` - Catches root-level errors (temporary for diagnostics)
- `app/error.tsx` - Route-level errors (already existed)

These make runtime errors visible instead of silent blank screens.

### 5. Health Endpoint

**Created `/health` route:**
- Quick verification that app is running
- Validates routing and SSR
- Useful for monitoring and smoke tests

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Local build succeeds
- [x] Lint passes (no ESLint errors)
- [x] Typecheck passes (no TypeScript errors)
- [x] Dev server starts without errors
- [ ] Cloudflare Preview deployment shows working homepage
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns "OK: health"
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Footer displays version correctly
- [ ] All recent homepage features intact
- [ ] Production deployment successful

## Lessons Learned

1. **Build Success ≠ Runtime Success**
   - Cloudflare Pages uses different runtime than Node.js
   - Build-time imports may fail at runtime
   - Always test with environment similar to production

2. **Error Boundaries Are Critical**
   - Without them, errors fail silently
   - Added global-error.tsx to surface issues immediately

3. **Documentation Matters**
   - Cloudflare Pages has specific requirements
   - Document configuration decisions in code comments
   - Maintain postmortem records for future reference

4. **Environment-Specific Testing**
   - Test with Cloudflare Preview deployments
   - Verify all components work in edge runtime
   - Don't rely solely on local development
