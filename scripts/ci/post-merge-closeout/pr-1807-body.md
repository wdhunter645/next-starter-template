## PRE-OPEN GATE PREFLIGHT (MANDATORY)

## CHANGE SUMMARY
- Added `docs/ops/reports/program-1500-queue-wave-reconciliation.md` with Program #1500 reconciliation table, queue/wave lane status table, gap inventory, and explicit boundary statements (#1500 closed; remaining work under #1719/#1725+; no automatic Cursor authorization).
- Updated `lgfc-program-queue-and-dependency-map.md` with Priority #3 dependency-map excerpt and #1500 closed-complete reconciliation cross-reference.
- Updated Priority #3 readiness, registry, backlog, and PMO v3 operating model to record Task #1725 reconciliation and remove stale "#1500 is next prioritized program" language.

## BUILD / TEST / VERIFICATION
- Commands run:
  - `bash scripts/ci/docs_check_headers.sh .` (with changed-file list) — **PASSED**
  - `rg` consistency grep for #1500 closed / #1719 / #1725 references in touched paths — **PASS**
- Gate verification:
  - Commit-level workflow runs inspected: YES
  - PR-level governance/accounting workflows inspected: YES
  - Failed job logs inspected for every failing gate: YES (remediated body disposition parser alignment)
  - Required gates rerun or re-evaluated after fixes: YES
  - Optional merge-commit workflow noise (`Enforce PR Only Changes` on merge push association check) classified non-blocking for this docs-only reconciliation PR
- Result summary: PASS (docs validation; post-merge closeout body remediated)

## Program #1500 reconciliation summary
| Area | Conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| Charter outcomes 1–5 | **Closed complete** on `main`; evidence in #1544–#1548 and CI reference docs |
| Post-merge closeout baseline | **Satisfied** — single automatic owner (`post-merge-closeout.yml`), pre-merge readiness gate, bounded support paths |
| Remaining caveats | Deferred CI maintenance only (full inventory rewrite, branch protection UI, legacy workflow retirement, runtime umbrella classifier) |
| Ownership after closure | Future CI work requires **new source issues**; Priority #3 must not rebuild #1500 |

## Queue/wave model reconciliation summary
| Category | State |
| --- | --- |
| Completed lanes | #1500, #1256, #1258, #1259 Phase 4, #1448 rebaseline, execution-mode documentation |
| Active follow-on | #1255 terminal closeout; Priority #3 #1719 chain |
| Blocked lanes | #1720–#1724 (open predecessors), #1726–#1727, parked #1685, queued #1700 |
| Next authorized boundary | **#1726** after #1725 closeout |
