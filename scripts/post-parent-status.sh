## Status Report: After-Action Backlog Finalization

### What Changed (PRs #79‚Äì#82)

**PR #79: Operationalize after-action reports** ‚úÖ MERGED
- Archived 7 completion reports from root to `docs/archive/`
- Created OPERATIONAL_BACKLOG.md analyzing all reports
- Built 10+ issue templates with A‚ÜíG acceptance criteria
- Reduced root clutter from 20+ to 10 markdown files

**PR #80: Create operational backlog with automation** ‚úÖ MERGED
- Analyzed 6 after-action reports for 8 prioritized items
- Security finding: 18 secrets briefly exposed (rotation required)
- Created comprehensive specs with A‚ÜíG loops for each item
- Built automation script for GitHub issue creation

**PR #81: Add Social Wall page** ‚úÖ MERGED
- Implemented public `/social` route with Elfsight widget
- No CSP configuration needed (none exists)
- Build and lint passing
- Closes #77

**PR #82: Add acceptance checks and security hardening** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- .gitignore hardening: added `/docs/archive/*.bak`, `/OPERATIONAL_BACKLOG.md.log`
- Created `scripts/md_secret_audit.sh` for markdown secret scanning
- Added `.github/workflows/docs-audit.yml` CI workflow
- Added `npm run audit:docs` script

### CI/CD Status

**Build & Lint** ‚úÖ PASSING
```bash
‚úì npm install - Dependencies installed
‚úì npm run lint - No ESLint warnings/errors
‚úì npm run build - Production build successful
‚úì All 20 routes compile and render
```

**Cloudflare Preview Verdict** ‚ÑπÔ∏è WORKING AS DESIGNED
- Deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) only runs on `main` branch
- PRs #79-#82 are on feature branches ‚Üí no preview deployments triggered
- This is intentional to prevent resource consumption
- Docs-only PRs do NOT break builds; they simply don't trigger deploys
- **Status**: No issue found; workflow correctly configured

**Docs Secret Audit** ‚ö†Ô∏è DETECTS PATTERNS (EXPECTED)
- Script finds 40+ references to secret-related keywords in docs
- These are mostly documentation examples and setup guides (expected)
- Pattern: `(KEY|SECRET|TOKEN|PASSWORD|SUPABASE|CLOUDFLARE_|AWS_)`
- **Action**: Review findings to ensure no actual credentials exposed
- Run `npm run audit:docs` to see full report

### Outstanding Items

1. **Normalize A‚ÜíG acceptance checks in PR descriptions (#79-#82)** - Agent
   - Cannot update PR descriptions via API
   - Documentation and templates provided
   - Manual action required

2. **Create parent tracking issue** - Agent/User
   - Run `./scripts/create-parent-issue.sh` to create
   - Issue template ready with full context

3. **Post status on parent issue** - This comment!

4. **Link PRs to parent issue** - User
   - Add parent issue number to each PR description
   - Format: `**Tracks**: #<parent-issue-number>`

5. **Security: Rotate exposed secrets** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
   - 18 credentials briefly in git history (from PR #80 findings)
   - Repository owner action required
   - See OPERATIONAL_BACKLOG.md Issue #3

6. **Health checks verification** - Agent  
   - ‚úÖ Build passing
   - ‚úÖ Lint passing
   - üìã Typecheck: No script in package.json (can add if needed)
