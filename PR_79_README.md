## üöÄ Next Steps (Required)

### Why Issues Aren't Created Yet

GitHub issue creation requires authenticated API access. The Copilot agent environment doesn't have the necessary credentials to create issues programmatically. **This is expected and normal.**

### How to Create the Issues

You have **three options**:

#### Option 1: Use the Automation Script (Fastest)

```bash
# Prerequisites: gh CLI installed and authenticated
gh auth login

# Run the script
./create-backlog-issues.sh

# The script will:
# - Create 1 parent issue
# - Create 8 sub-issues
# - Auto-link them together
# - Display next steps
```

#### Option 2: Manual with gh CLI

```bash
# Authenticate first
gh auth login

# Create parent issue
gh issue create --title "Operational Backlog from After-Action Reports" \
  --body-file docs/backlog/PARENT_ISSUE.md \
  --label "ops,backlog,automation"

# Note the issue number, then create sub-issues
# (See docs/backlog/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for details)
```

#### Option 3: Manual via GitHub Web UI

1. Go to: https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/issues/new
2. Copy content from `docs/backlog/PARENT_ISSUE.md`
3. Set title: "Operational Backlog from After-Action Reports"
4. Add labels: `ops`, `backlog`, `automation`
5. Create issue and note the number
6. Repeat for each sub-issue in `docs/backlog/SUB_ISSUE_*.md`

### After Creating Issues

1. **Update PR #79 Description** with issue checklist
2. **Link PR #79 to Parent Issue** (add "Closes #[N]" to PR description)
3. **Post Status Comment** on parent issue (template in `docs/backlog/README.md`)

Detailed instructions: **`docs/backlog/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

## üéì Learning & Best Practices

This backlog demonstrates:

1. **Comprehensive Issue Documentation** - Each issue is self-contained
2. **Repeatable Acceptance Criteria** - A‚ÜíG loop ensures consistency
3. **Clear Prioritization** - Security, quick wins, then enhancements
4. **Rollback Plans** - Every issue includes rollback instructions
5. **Automated Workflows** - Script reduces manual work

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why weren't the issues created automatically?**
A: GitHub issue creation requires authenticated API access, which isn't available in the Copilot agent environment. This is normal and expected.

**Q: Can I create issues in a different order?**
A: Yes! While Issue #3 (secrets) should be first due to security, others can be done in any order or in parallel.

**Q: What if I don't want to use all 8 issues?**
A: That's fine! Each issue is independent. Create only the ones relevant to your priorities.

**Q: Can I modify the issue specifications?**
A: Absolutely! These are templates. Adjust them to fit your needs before creating the issues.

**Q: How long will this take to complete?**
A: Total estimated effort is 20-27 hours. Spread across 2-3 weeks with proper prioritization, it's very manageable.
