# Manual Cloudflare Pages Deployment Implementation

## Summary

This implementation provides a comprehensive manual deployment script for Cloudflare Pages that can be used when CI/CD is failing or when manual deployments are needed.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Main Script: `scripts/manual-deploy-pages.sh`

A fully-featured Bash script that implements all requirements from the problem statement:

#### Step 0: Credential Verification
- ✅ Validates `CF_API_TOKEN` exists (must have Account > Cloudflare Pages > Edit permissions)
- ✅ Validates `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` exists
- ✅ Fails fast with clear error messages if credentials are missing
- ✅ References CF docs/pages-action notes for token requirements

#### Step 1: Build Process
- ✅ Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies
- ✅ Runs `npm run build` to build Next.js project
- ✅ Runs `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@latest --experimental-minify` to prepare artifact
- ✅ Verifies `.vercel/output/static` exists, exits with code 11 if not

#### Step 2: Project Creation (Idempotent)
- ✅ Creates `lgfc-staging` project if not exists
- ✅ Creates `lgfc-prod` project if not exists
- ✅ Uses `|| true` to make commands idempotent

#### Step 3: Manual Deployments
- ✅ Deploys to staging: `npx wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name lgfc-staging`
- ✅ Deploys to production: `npx wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name lgfc-prod --branch main --commit-dirty=true`
- ✅ Exits with code 23 on deployment failure

#### Step 4: URL Extraction
- ✅ Extracts staging URL using `npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name lgfc-staging --format json | jq -r '.[0].url'`
- ✅ Extracts production URL using `npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name lgfc-prod --format json | jq -r '.[0].url'`
- ✅ Displays discovered URLs clearly

#### Step 5: Smoke Checks
- ✅ Tests staging health endpoint: `curl -sf "$STAGING_URL/api/healthz"`
- ✅ Tests production health endpoint: `curl -sf "$PROD_URL/api/healthz"`
- ✅ Exits with code 1 if smoke checks fail

#### Step 6: Optional Monitor Secrets
- ✅ Provides instructions for seeding uptime monitor secrets
- ✅ Shows example commands: `gh secret set LGFC_STAGING_URL` and `gh secret set LGFC_PROD_URL`
- ✅ Includes commented-out commands for easy enabling

#### Step 7: Orchestrator Integration
- ✅ Calls `bash scripts/deploy-pages-orchestrator.sh` if it exists
- ✅ Uses `|| true` to prevent failure if orchestrator fails

### 2. Validation Script: `scripts/validate-manual-deploy-pages.sh`

A comprehensive test suite that validates the manual deployment script:

- ✅ 15 validation tests covering all aspects of the script
- ✅ Tests syntax, structure, and functionality
- ✅ Verifies credential validation works
- ✅ Confirms all required commands are present
- ✅ Checks for proper exit codes
- ✅ Validates shellcheck passes
- ✅ All tests passing successfully

### 3. Documentation: `scripts/README_MANUAL_DEPLOY.md`

Complete documentation including:

- ✅ Overview and prerequisites
- ✅ Cloudflare API token permission requirements
- ✅ Installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Step-by-step explanation of what the script does
- ✅ Expected output examples
- ✅ Exit code documentation
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Security notes

## Key Features

### Error Handling
- Uses `set -e` to fail fast on errors
- Clear, colored output for success/failure messages
- Specific exit codes for different failure scenarios:
  - Exit 1: Credential validation or smoke check failure
  - Exit 11: Build output directory not found
  - Exit 23: Deployment failure

### User Experience
- Colored output using ANSI escape codes (blue, green, yellow, red)
- Clear step-by-step progress indicators
- Visual separators between major steps
- Comprehensive final summary showing both deployment URLs

### Idempotency
- Project creation commands use `|| true` to avoid failures if projects exist
- Can be run multiple times safely

### Integration
- Calls existing `deploy-pages-orchestrator.sh` script
- Uses existing `/api/healthz` endpoint for smoke tests
- Follows existing patterns from the codebase

## Files Added

1. `scripts/manual-deploy-pages.sh` (175 lines) - Main deployment script
2. `scripts/validate-manual-deploy-pages.sh` (192 lines) - Validation test suite
3. `scripts/README_MANUAL_DEPLOY.md` (140 lines) - Comprehensive documentation
4. `MANUAL_DEPLOY_SUMMARY.md` (this file) - Implementation summary

## Testing

All components have been tested:

- ✅ Bash syntax validation passes
- ✅ Shellcheck linting passes with no warnings
- ✅ All 15 validation tests pass
- ✅ Credential validation works correctly
- ✅ Script structure matches problem statement exactly
- ✅ `.gitignore` excludes build artifacts (`.vercel/`)

## Usage

To use the manual deployment script:

```bash
# Export Cloudflare credentials
export CF_API_TOKEN="your-cloudflare-api-token"
export CF_ACCOUNT_ID="your-cloudflare-account-id"

# Run the script
cd /path/to/next-starter-template
bash scripts/manual-deploy-pages.sh
```

To validate the script:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-manual-deploy-pages.sh
```

## Notes

- The script implements exactly what was specified in the problem statement
- All steps are clearly numbered and commented
- The implementation is production-ready and follows best practices
- Security is maintained by requiring environment variables for credentials
- The script integrates seamlessly with existing workflows and scripts

## Next Steps

The script is ready to use immediately. When needed:

1. Set the required environment variables
2. Run the script to manually deploy
3. Use the output URLs to verify deployments
4. Optionally seed the uptime monitor secrets as shown in Step 6

The validation script can be run at any time to ensure the manual deployment script remains correct.
