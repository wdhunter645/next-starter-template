# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Deployment Issue Identified

## Quick Summary

**Your builds are succeeding but deployments are failing.** This is why your production site is 8+ days old.

## The Problem

PR #142 successfully builds your application but **fails to deploy** due to a missing permission on your Cloudflare API token.

### Error Message
```
Authentication error [code: 10000]
Are you missing the `User->User Details->Read` permission?
```

## The Fix (5 Minutes)

You need to update one setting in Cloudflare:

### Step 1: Update Your Cloudflare API Token

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Find and **Edit** the token you're using for GitHub Actions
3. Add this permission: **User â†’ User Details â†’ Read**
4. Keep the existing: **Account â†’ Cloudflare Pages â†’ Edit**
5. Click "Update Token" and **copy the new token**

### Step 2: Update GitHub Secret

1. Go to: https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click on `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
3. Click "Update secret"
4. Paste your new token
5. Click "Update secret"

### Step 3: Test It

1. Go to: https://github.com/wdhunter645/next-starter-template/actions/workflows/deploy.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select branch: `main`
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Watch it deploy successfully! âœ…

## Why This Happened

- **PR #139** removed deployments because of this auth error
- **PR #140-141** only built (didn't deploy)
- **PR #142** tried to restore deployments but didn't fix the token
- **Result:** Builds work, deployments fail, production is stale

## What You Get After the Fix

âœ… Automatic deployments on every push to main  
âœ… Production stays up-to-date with latest code  
âœ… No more manual deployment steps needed  
âœ… Full visibility in GitHub Actions

## Alternative: Use Cloudflare Git Integration

If you prefer not to use API tokens:

1. Go to Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Connect your GitHub repo directly
3. Configure build: `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`
4. Output directory: `.open-next`
5. Cloudflare auto-deploys on every push

This works but gives you less control. The API token fix (above) is recommended.

---

**Bottom line:** Add "User Details Read" to your Cloudflare API token, update the GitHub secret, and your deployments will start working immediately.
