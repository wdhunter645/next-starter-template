## I. Life and Career (1903–1941)

**Henry Louis “Lou” Gehrig** was born June 19, 1903, in New York City to German immigrant parents. He attended Columbia University before joining Major League Baseball.

Gehrig played his entire 17-year career with the New York Yankees (1923–1939). He earned the nickname **“The Iron Horse”** for playing in **2,130 consecutive games**, a record that stood until 1995.

Career highlights:
- Batting average: .340
- Home runs: 493
- Runs batted in: 1,995
- 7× All-Star
- 2× American League MVP
- 6× World Series champion

In 1939, Gehrig experienced a rapid physical decline. On May 2, 1939, he voluntarily removed himself from the Yankees lineup. He was soon diagnosed with **amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**.

On July 4, 1939, during Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium, he delivered his famous farewell address, expressing gratitude rather than resentment. He died on June 2, 1941, at age 37.

## II. Posthumous Impact (1941–1965)

Following his death, Gehrig was immediately memorialized:
- The Yankees retired his uniform number **4**
- A plaque and monument were installed at Yankee Stadium
- He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame via special election

In 1942, the film *The Pride of the Yankees*, starring Gary Cooper, introduced Gehrig’s life story to a national audience. The film played a major role in shaping Gehrig’s public image as a model of humility, courage, and quiet strength.

During this period, Gehrig’s name became increasingly synonymous with ALS in the public consciousness.

## III. Legacy and Cultural Impact (1966–2025)

By the late 20th century, ALS was commonly referred to as **“Lou Gehrig’s disease.”** His legacy expanded beyond baseball into health advocacy and public awareness.

Key milestones:
- 2014: The Ice Bucket Challenge raised over $115 million globally for ALS research
- 2021: Major League Baseball established **Lou Gehrig Day**, observed annually on June 2

Today, Lou Gehrig remains:
- One of baseball’s most revered figures
- A central symbol in the fight against ALS
- A reference point for discussions of sportsmanship, dignity, and perseverance
